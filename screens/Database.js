It is widely distributed along the Himalayas in South Asia and extending into the forests of Southeast Asia. They are short-tailed and stout birds which forage in pairs in dense undergrowth close to the ground and their presence is indicated by their distinctive calls.\n</p>\n\n\n<h2><span id=\"Taxonomy\">Taxonomy</span></h2>\n<p>Abbott's babbler was described by the English zoologist Edward Blyth in 1845 and given the binomial name <i>Malacocincla abbotti</i>. The genus name <i>Malacocincla</i> combines the Ancient Greek <i>malakos</i> meaning \"soft\" with modern Latin <i>cinclus</i>, meaning \"thrush\"; referring to the birds' full and drooping plumage. The specific name <i>abbotti</i> was chosen by Blyth to honour the specimen collector, Lieutenant Colonel J. R. Abbott (1811\u20131888) who served in British India as Assistant Commissioner of the Arakan from 1837 to 1845. Blyth erected the new genus <i>Malacocincla</i> for this species but subsequent workers placed the species in <i>Turdinus</i> and <i>Trichastoma</i>. A revision reinstated its placement in <i>Malacocincla</i> in 1985. A 2001 study confirmed the cohesiveness of the <i>Trichastoma</i> group but a 2012 study shows that <i>M. abbotti</i> and <i>M. sepiaria</i> are in a clade along with Napothera while <i>M. cinereiceps</i> and <i>M. malaccensis</i> fall into a different clade along with the genus <i>Trichastoma</i> and several species of <i>Pellorneum</i>. An isolated population occurs in the Visakhapatnam Ghats, well separated from the nearest main distribution along the Himalayas and was named after Indian ornithologist K.S.R. Krishna Raju by Dillon Ripley and Bruce Beehler in 1985. The nominate population is from southern Myanmar and extends to southern Tenasserim and northwestern Malaya including the Langkawi Islands. Several other populations of this widespread species have been named as subspecies and not all are recognized. The population in the eastern Himalayas from eastern Nepal to Sikkim and Assam was named as <i>amabile</i> but is now considered within the nominate subspecies. Others include <i>altera</i> (central Laos and Annam), <i>williamsoni</i> (eastern Thailand and northwestern Cambodia), <i>obscurior</i> (coastal southeastern Thailand), <i>olivaceum</i> (Peninsular Thailand and Malaya), <i>sirense</i> (Borneo, Pulau Mata Siri) and <i>baweanum</i> (Bawean Island).</p><p>Eight subspecies are recognised:</p>\n<ul><li><i>M. a. abbotti</i> Blyth, 1845 \u2013 east Himalayas to central Malay Peninsula</li>\n<li><i>M. a. krishnarajui</i> Ripley &amp; Beehler, 1985 \u2013 east India</li>\n<li><i>M. a. williamsoni</i> Deignan, 1948 \u2013 east Thailand to south Vietnam</li>\n<li><i>M. a. obscurior</i> Deignan, 1948 \u2013 east Thailand and southwest Cambodia</li>\n<li><i>M. a. altera</i> (Sims, 1957) \u2013 central Laos and central Vietnam</li>\n<li><i>M. a. olivacea</i> (Strickland, 1847) \u2013 south Malay Peninsula and Sumatra</li>\n<li><i>M. a. concreta</i> B\u00fcttikofer, 1895 \u2013 Borneo and Belitung Island</li>\n<li><i>M. a. baweana</i> Oberholser, 1917 \u2013 Bawean Island (north of Java)</li></ul><h2><span id=\"Description\">Description</span></h2>\n\n<p>The adult Abbott's babbler is a nondescript, brown, short-tailed, babbler that moves about in the low vegetation often near streams and in the vicinity of tree ferns and tangled vegetation. The throat is grey-white while the center of the belly is white and the flanks are olive. The undertail coverts are rusty-colored. The sexes are alike. It has a short tail and heavy bill; it is drab olive-brown with bright rusty lower flanks and vent, a greyish-white throat and breast and variable pale grey supercilium and lores. Juvenile birds have dark rufescent-brown crowns and upperparts. The calls are distinctive. The subspecies <i>M. a. krishnarajui</i> of the Eastern Ghats has a darker russet tail and rump than the Himalayan nominate subspecies. Specimens measure 12\u201313\u00a0cm (4.7\u20135.1\u00a0in) in length, with a head of 39\u201344\u00a0mm (1.5\u20131.7\u00a0in) and tail of 55\u201361\u00a0mm (2.2\u20132.4\u00a0in).</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Distribution_and_habitat\">Distribution and habitat</span></h2>\n\n<p>In South Asia, Abbott's babbler is resident from Nepal to Arunachal Pradesh and the Assam Valley in India, south throughout the South Assam hills, including Meghalaya and south through the Lushai Hills. It is also resident in east and south Bangladesh (around Jessore and Khulna), and the Eastern Ghats in North-east Andhra Pradesh and Odisha. It occurs up to 600\u00a0m (2000\u00a0ft), 275\u00a0m (900\u00a0ft) in Nepal. It is widely distributed across Southeast Asia.</p><p>It is common across much of its large range. It is seen in the understory of broadleaved evergreen forest, forest edge, secondary growth and scrub. In Singapore, they have been noted as being tolerant to disturbance and adapting to secondary growth and disturbed forest.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Behaviour_and_ecology\">Behaviour and ecology</span></h2>\n<p>Abbott's babbler usually moves around in pairs close to the ground. They breed from April to July (summer monsoon), with the nest being a carefully placed but bulky cup low in palms or other undergrowth. A study in Thailand found that most nests are placed in spiny palms and rattans. The usual clutch is 3 to 5 eggs which are bright salmon with dark blotches and red lines. When disturbed at the nest, the bird slip over the edge and fly with laboured wing beats and then hop out of sight. More than one brood may be raised in a season.</p><p>Their distinctive calls consists of three or four notes with the a drop on the middle note. The antiphonal duet of a male and female has the male leading with a \"poor'ol bear\" followed by the females \"dear dear\". The tunes may however change over time. The birds tend to remain within a well marked area and do not wander widely. The song is a variable short series of around three to four notes of rich, fluty, liquid, slurred, short whistled notes; these are sometimes delivered haltingly and sometimes rapidly. The evening group song consists of a recurrent sputtering <i>churrr</i> sound, which is low and slurred; ending with a sharp <i>chreep</i>. Calls include soft mewing notes, and a pulsing, purring trill when agitated.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n\n<h2><span id=\"External_links\">External links</span></h2>\n<ul><li>Call recordings on Xeno-Canto</li>\n<li>Images and videos</li></ul>"

Adults have a white head freckled with dark spots, and a pure white neck and underparts. The upperparts are glossy blue-black upperparts, with bluish and greenish iridescence especially prominent on the secondaries (lower arm feathers). The male is much larger than the female, and has a large black knob on the bill. Young birds are dull buff below and on the face and neck, with dull brown upperparts, top of the head and eyestripe. Knob-billed ducks are generally larger in size when compared to comb ducks, and flanks are usually lighter (light grey, in females sometimes whitish).\n</p><p>Immature knob-billed ducks look like a large greyish female of the cotton pygmy goose (<i>Nettapus coromandelicus</i>) and may be difficult to tell apart if no other birds are around to compare size and hue.

As the \"perching ducks\" were split up, the knob-billed duck was moved to the Tadorninae or shelduck subfamily.</p><p>Analysis of mtDNA sequences of the cytochrome <i>b</i> and NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 genes, however, suggests that it is a quite basal member of the Anatidae, vindicating the earliest placement.

It is named after Alexander the Great, who transported numerous birds from Punjab to various European and Mediterranean countries and regions, where they were prized by the royalty, nobility and warlords.</p><p>The Alexandrine parakeet has established feral populations in Spain, England, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Iran, Hong Kong where it lives alongside feral populations of its close relative, the rose-ringed parakeet (<i>Psittacula krameri</i>).</p>\n\n\n<h2><span id=\"Taxonomy_and_etymology\">Taxonomy and etymology</span></h2>\n<p>The Alexandrine parakeet was first described by French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson as <i>Psittaca Ginginiana</i> or \"La Perruche de Gingi\" (The Gingi's Parakeet) in 1760; after the town of Gingee in southeastern India, which was a French outpost then. The birds may, however, merely have been held in captivity there. Carl Linnaeus redescribed the Alexandrine parakeet in 1766 as <i>Psittacus eupatria</i>.</p>\n\n<p>The genus name <i>Psittacula</i> is a diminutive of the Latin word <i>psittacus</i> meaning \"parrot\", and the specific name <i>eupatria</i> is derived from the Ancient Greek words <i>eu-</i> meaning \"well\" and <i>patri\u00e1</i> meaning \"descent\".</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Phylogeny\">Phylogeny</span></h2>\n<p>Genetic analysis of the mitochondrial cytochrome b sequences of <i>Psittacula</i> parakeets has shown that the Alexandrine parakeet diverged from the lineage that gave rise to the rose-ringed parakeet (<i>Psittacula krameri</i>) and the Mauritius parakeet (<i>Psittacula eques</i>) about 5 million years ago.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Description\">Description</span></h2>\n\n<p>The Alexandrine parakeet is one of the largest parakeets, measuring 56 to 62\u00a0cm (22 to 24\u00a0in) from the top of the head to the tip of the tail and weighing 200 to 300\u00a0g (7.1 to 10.6\u00a0oz). The tail measures 28 to 35\u00a0cm (11 to 14\u00a0in). It is predominantly green with a light blue-grey sheen on the cheeks and nape (back of the neck), yellow-green abdomen, red patch on the shoulders and massive red beak with yellow tips. The upperside of the tail passes from green at the top to blue further down, and is yellow at the tip. The underside of the tail is yellow.</p><p>Adults are sexually dimorphic. Adult males have a black stripe across their lower cheeks and a pink band on their nape. Adult females lack both a black stripe across their lower cheeks and a pink band on their nape. The young are similar in appearance to adult females but have shorter tails.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Subspecies\">Subspecies</span></h2>\n<p>Five subspecies of the Alexandrine parakeet are currently recognized. Information on the distribution and plumage differences of the different subspecies is given below.</p>\n\n<h2><span id=\"Ecology_and_behaviour\">Ecology and behaviour</span></h2>\n<p>The Alexandrine parakeet lives in forests, woodlands, agricultural lands and mangrove forests at elevations of up to 900 m (3,000 ft). It eats a variety of wild and cultivated seeds, buds, fruits and nuts. Flocks can cause extensive damage to ripening fruits and grain crops like maize and jowar. It usually lives in small flocks, but forms larger groups in areas where food is abundant or at communal roosts.</p>\n\n<p>The Alexandrine parakeet has a variety of calls, including a ringing <i>trrrieuw</i>, loud <i>kree-aar</i> or <i>keeak</i>, deep <i>klak-klak-klak-klak</i> and resonant <i>gr-aak</i>. Its calls are usually deeper, harsher and more resonant than those of the rose-ringed parakeet. Its voice becomes harsher when alarmed, and it shrieks loudly when mobbing predators. Flocks occasionally excitedly vocalize together. It is known to imitate human speech in captivity.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Breeding\">Breeding</span></h3>\n\n<p>Alexandrine parakeets breed from November to April in their native range. They usually nest in tree hollows, but sometimes use tree holes excavated by themselves or cracks in buildings. Females lay 2 to 4 white, blunt oval-shaped eggs, measuring 27 to 34\u00a0mm (1.1 to 1.3\u00a0in). The average incubation period is 24 days. The chicks fledge at about 7 weeks of age, and are dependent on their parents until 3 to 4 months of age.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Aviculture\">Aviculture</span></h2>\n<p>Alexandrine parakeets are relatively popular pet birds due to their long lifespan in captivity, playful behaviour and ability to mimic human speech. Alexander the Great is thought to have kept one as a pet. They are one of the most sought-after cage birds in the Indian market. According to CITES trade data, at least 57,772 Alexandrine parakeets were imported into countries outside their native range between 1981 and 2014.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Conservation\">Conservation</span></h2>\n<p>The Alexandrine parakeet is listed as near threatened by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) because of its steep population decline in its native range due to habitat loss, persecution and excessive capture to cater to the demands of the illegal wildlife trade. It is sporadic in South India, uncommon in Bangladesh, and declining in North Bengal and certain parts of Sri Lanka. It has suffered the greatest population declines in the Sindh and Punjab provinces of Pakistan, Laos, northwestern and southwestern Cambodia, and Thailand.</p><p>The sale of Alexandrine parakeets is banned in Pakistan, but they can be found being openly sold in the markets of Lahore and Rawalpindi. Their sale is also banned in India, and yet they are sold in broad daylight in urban bird markets, suggesting that the Indian government is allocating insufficient resources for their protection.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Culture\">Culture</span></h2>\n\n<p>Sri Lanka, Vietnam, Thailand, Mongolia and Iran have issued postage stamps depicting the Alexandrine parakeet.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n\n<h2><span id=\"Further_reading\">Further reading</span></h2>\n<ul><li class=\"mw-empty-elt\">\n<li>Alexandrine Parakeet (Psittacula eupatria) | Parrot Encyclopedia by the World Parrot Trust</li>\n<li class=\"mw-empty-elt\">\n<li><i>Birds of the Indian Subcontinent</i> by Richard Grimmett, Carol Inskipp and Tim Inskipp, <link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r951705291\">ISBN\u00a01408127636</li></ul><h2><span id=\"External_links\">External links</span></h2>\n<ul><li class=\"mw-empty-elt\">\n<li>Wildscreen Arkive: Alexandrine parakeet (Psittacula eupatria) Gallery and fact sheet</li>\n<li class=\"mw-empty-elt\">\n<li>Oriental Bird Images: <i>Alexandrine parakeet</i> Selected images</li></ul> "

The Alpine accentor, along with the Altai accentor is sometimes separated from the other accentors, into the genus <i>Laiscopus</i>.</p><p>The word \"accentor\" is from post-classical Latin and means a person who sings with another. The genus name <i>Prunella</i> is from the German <i>Braunelle</i>, \"dunnock\", a diminutive of <i>braun</i>, \"brown\".</p><p>Nine subspecies are recognised:</p>\n<ul><li><i>P. c. collaris</i> (Scopoli, 1769) \u2013 southwest Europe to Slovenia and the Carpathians, northwest Africa</li>\n<li><i>P. c. subalpina</i> (Brehm, CL, 1831) \u2013 Croatia to Bulgaria and Greece, Crete and southwest Turkey</li>\n<li><i>P. c. montana</i> (Hablizl, 1783) \u2013 north and east Turkey to the Caucasus and Iran</li>\n<li><i>P. c. rufilata</i> (Severtzov, 1879) \u2013 northeast Afghanistan and north Pakistan through the mountains of central Asia to west China</li>\n<li><i>P. c. whymperi</i> (Baker, ECS, 1915) \u2013 west Himalayas</li>\n<li><i>P. c. nipalensis</i> (Blyth, 1843) \u2013 central and east Himalayas to southcentral China and north Myanmar</li>\n<li><i>P. c. tibetana</i> (Bianchi, 1905) \u2013 east Tibet</li>\n<li><i>P. c. erythropygia</i> (R. Swinhoe, 1870) \u2013 east Kazakhstan and southcentral Siberia to northeast Siberia, Japan, Korea and northeast China</li>\n<li><i>P. c. fennelli</i> Deignan, 1964 \u2013 Taiwan</li></ul><h2><span id=\"Description\">Description</span></h2>\n\n<p>This is a robin-sized bird at 15\u201317.5\u00a0cm in length, slightly larger than its relative, the dunnock. It has a streaked brown back, somewhat resembling a house sparrow, but adults have a grey head and red-brown spotting on the underparts. It has an insectivore's fine pointed bill.\n</p><p>Sexes are similar, although the male may be contrasted in appearance. Young birds have browner heads and underparts.\n</p>\n\n<h2><span id=\"Distribution_and_habitat\">Distribution and habitat</span></h2>\n<p>It is found throughout the mountains of southern temperate Europe, Lebanon and Asia at heights above 2000\u00a0m. It is mainly resident, wintering more widely at lower latitudes, but some birds wander as rare vagrants as far as Great Britain.\n</p><p>It is a bird of bare mountain areas with some low vegetation.\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Breeding\">Breeding</span></h2>\n<p>It builds a neat nest low in a bush or rock crevice, laying 3-5 unspotted sky-blue eggs.\n</p><p>The mating system is of particular interest.  Home ranges are occupied by breeding groups of 3 or 4 males with 3 or 4 females.  These are unrelated birds which have a socially polygynandrous mating system.  Males have a dominance hierarchy, with the alpha males being generally older than subordinates.  Females seek matings with all the males, although the alpha male may defend her against matings from lower ranking males.  In turn, males seek matings with all the females.  DNA fingerprinting has been used to show that, within broods, there is often mixed paternity, although the female is always the true mother of the nestlings raised within her nest.  Males will provide food to chicks at several nests within the group, depending on whether they have mated with the female or not - males only provide care when they are likely to be the true fathers of the chicks.\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n\n<h2><span id=\"Further_reading\">Further reading</span></h2>\n<ul><li><cite id=\"CITEREFCramp1988\" class=\"citation book\">Cramp, Stanley;  et al., eds.

        "details": "<p class=\"mw-empty-elt\">\n</p>\n<p>The <b>Alpine swift</b> (<i>Tachymarptis melba</i>) formerly <i>Apus melba</i>, is a species of swift. The genus name is from the Ancient Greek <i>takhus</i>, \"fast\", and <i>marptis</i>, \"seizer\". The specific name <i>melba</i> comes from \u2018melano-alba\u2019 or \u2018mel-alba\u2019; Eigenhuis &amp; Swaab (1992) posited that \u2018melba\u2019 might be a short form for \u2018melano-alba\u2019 or \u2018mel-alba\u2019 (Gr. melas, melanos = black; L. albus = white). Linnaeus certainly referred to these two colors in his diagnosis.</p><p>Alpine swifts breed in mountains from southern Europe to the Himalaya. Like common swifts, they are strongly migratory, and winter much further south in southern Africa.\n</p><p>Swifts have very short legs which are used for clinging to vertical surfaces. They never settle voluntarily on the ground, spending most of their lives in the air living on the insects they catch in their beaks. Alpine swift are able to stay aloft in the air for up to seven months at a time, even drinking water \"on the wing\".\n</p>\n\n\n<h2><span id=\"Description_and_biology\">Description and biology</span></h2>\n<p>The bird is superficially similar to a large barn swallow or house martin. It is, however, completely unrelated to those passerine species, since swifts are in the order Apodiformes. The resemblances between the groups are due to convergent evolution, reflecting similar life styles.\n</p><p>Swifts have very short legs which they use only for clinging to vertical surfaces. The scientific name Apodidae comes from the Ancient Greek <i>\u03b1\u03c0\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2, apous</i>, meaning \"without feet\". They never settle voluntarily on the ground.\n</p><p>Alpine swifts breed in mountains from southern Europe to the Himalaya. Like common swifts, they are strongly migratory, and winter much further south in southern Africa. They wander widely on migration, and are regularly seen in much of southern Europe, Salford and Asia. The species seems to have been much more widespread during the last ice age, with a large colony breeding, for example in the Late Pleistocene Cave No 16, Bulgaria, around 18,000\u201340,000 years ago. The same situation has been found for Komarowa Cave near Cz\u0119stochowa, Poland during a period about 20,000\u201340,000 years ago.</p>\n\n<p>These apodiformes build their nests in colonies in a suitable cliff hole or cave, laying two or three eggs. Swifts will return to the same sites year after year, rebuilding their nests when necessary, and pairing for life. Young swifts in the nest can drop their body temperature and become torpid if bad weather prevents their parents from catching insects nearby. They have adapted well to urban conditions, frequently nesting in old buildings in towns around the Mediterranean, where large, low-flying flocks are a familiar feature in summer. Alpine swifts have a short forked tail and very long swept-back wings that resemble a crescent or a boomerang but may (as in the image) be held stretched straight out. Their flight is slower and more powerful than that of their smaller relatives, with a call that is a drawn-out twittering (listen at right).\n</p><p>Alpine swifts are readily distinguished from the common swifts by their larger size and their white belly and throat. They are around twice as big as most other swifts in their range, about 20 to 23\u00a0cm (7.9 to 9.1\u00a0in) in length, with a wingspan of 57\u00a0cm (22\u00a0in) and a weight of around 100\u00a0g (3.5\u00a0oz). By comparison, the common swift has a wingspan of around 42\u00a0cm (17\u00a0in). They're largely dark brown in colour with a dark neck band that separates the white throat from the white belly.\nJuveniles are similar to adults, but their feathers are pale edged.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Life_on_the_wing\">Life on the wing</span></h2>\n<p>Alpine swifts spend most of their lives in the air, living on the insects they catch in their beaks. They drink on the wing, but roost on vertical cliffs or walls. A study published in 2013 showed Alpine swifts can spend over six months flying without having to land. All vital physiological processes, including sleep, can be performed while in air.\n</p><p>In 2011, Felix Liechti and his colleagues at the Swiss Ornithological Institute attached electronic tags that log movement to six alpine swifts and it was discovered that the birds could stay aloft in the air for more than 200 days straight.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n\n<h2><span id=\"External_links\">External links</span></h2>\n<ul><li>Ageing and sexing (PDF; 2.3 MB) by Javier Blasco-Zumeta &amp; Gerd-Michael Heinze</li>\n<li>Alpine swift - Species text in The Atlas of Southern African Birds</li></ul>\n<p>.\n</p> "

In flight, the wing lining is white, contrasting with the dark wing feathers. Adult males of the closely related red-footed falcon have a dark grey wing lining. In Africa, males can be confused with melanistic Gabar goshawks, but the chestnut on the vent is distinctive. Also, there may be some superficial resemblance to the sooty falcon and the grey kestrel, but those two species both have yellow feet and cere. The wings are long as in most falcons (with a span of 63\u201371\u00a0cm) and at rest the wing tip reaches or extends just beyond the tail-tip.</p><p>Females can be more difficult to identify as they share a pattern common to many falcons, but are distinctive in having an orange eye-ring, a red cere and reddish orange feet. Juveniles can be confused only with those of the red-footed falcon, but lack the buffy underwing coverts.\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Taxonomy\">Taxonomy</span></h2>\n<p>The Amur falcon was long considered a subspecies or morph of the red-footed falcon, but it is nowadays considered distinct. Nonetheless, it is the red-footed falcon's closest relative; their relationship to other falcons is more enigmatic. They appear morphologically somewhat intermediate between kestrels and hobbies and DNA sequence data has been unable to further resolve this question, mainly due to lack of comprehensive sampling.</p><p>The genus name <i>Falco</i> is Late Latin and derives from <i>falx</i>, <i>falcis</i>, a sickle, referencing the claws of the bird. The species name <i> amurensis </i> is from Amurland in south-eastern Siberia.</p>\n\n<h2><span id=\"Distribution_and_migration\">Distribution and migration</span></h2>\n<p>The Amur falcon breeds in east Asia from the Transbaikalia, Amurland, and northern Mongolian region to parts of North Korea. They migrate in a broad front through India and Sri Lanka, sometimes further east over Thailand and Cambodia and then over the Arabian Sea, sometimes in passage on the Maldives and other islands to reach southern Africa. Birds going over India are thought to be aided by strong winds blowing westward. These winds are strong at an altitude of about 3000m and the birds are thought to fly at a height of above 1000m during migration. The route taken to return to their breeding grounds runs slightly more northward. Because of its tendency to wander long distances over the ocean while migrating, this falcon has been found in locations far outside its normal range, such as in Italy, Sweden, Tristan da Cunha, St. Helena and the United Kingdom.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Behaviour_and_ecology\">Behaviour and ecology</span></h2>\n<h3><span id=\"Foraging_and_food\">Foraging and food</span></h3>\n<p>The Amur falcon feeds mainly late in the evening or early in the morning capturing a wide range of insects in the air or on the ground. They capture most of their prey in flight, sometimes by hovering, but will also pick prey by alighting on the ground. The winter diet appears to be almost entirely made up of insects but they take small birds, mammals  and amphibians to feed their young in their breeding range. The rains in Africa produce swarms of termites, locusts, ants and beetles that provide ample food. Their migration over the Arabian Sea coincides with the timing of the migration of dragonflies (<i>Pantala flavescens</i>) and these are thought to provide food during the most arduous part of their migration route.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Nesting\">Nesting</span></h3>\n\n<p>During migration they stay in open forest or grasslands, roosting colonially on exposed perches or wires. Their breeding habitat is open wooded country with marshes. The breeding season is May to June and several pairs may nest close together. Abandoned nest platforms belonging to birds of prey or corvids and even tree hollows are re-used for nesting. Three or four eggs are laid (at two day intervals). Both parents take turns to incubate and feed the chicks which hatch after about a month. The young birds leave the nest after about a month.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Parasites\">Parasites</span></h3>\n<p>The Amur falcon hosts three species of lice, <i>Degeeriella rufa</i>, <i>Colpocephalum subzerafae</i>, and <i>Laembothrion tinnunculi</i>.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Status_and_conservation\">Status and conservation</span></h2>\n<p>The wide breeding range and large population size of the Amur falcon have led to the species being assessed as being of least concern. The flocking behaviour during migration and the density at which they occur, however, expose them to hunting and other threats. During their migration from their breeding area to the winter quarters, they are plump and are hunted for food in parts of northeastern India as well as in eastern Africa.\nIn 2012, mass trapping and capture of migrating Amur falcons in Nagaland (India) was reported in the media and a successful campaign was begun to prevent their killing. As part of this campaign, three birds were fitted with 5 gm satellite transmitters that allowed them to be tracked during their migration.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n\n<h2><span id=\"Further_reading\">Further reading</span></h2>\n<ul><li>Adventures in Nagaland and Satellite tracks of three individuals</li>\n<li>How to make 2.5 billion termites disappear?

Some subspecies have white markings on the head. Young birds are dull brownish grey.\n</p><p>Subspecies <i>longicaudatus</i> of India (which includes <i>beavani</i> of the Himalayas that winters on the peninsula, with one breeding population in central India that Vaurie separates as <i>longicaudatus</i> in the restricted sense) is very dark and almost like the black drongo although this bird is slimmer and has a somewhat longer and less-splayed tail. It is found in more tall forest habitat, has dark grey underside lacking the sheen of black drongo. The iris is crimson and there is no white rictal spot. Subspecies <i>leucogenis</i> and <i>salangensis</i> have a white eye-patch as do several of the island forms that breed further south. The calls are a little more nasal and twangy than that of the black drongo.</p><p><br></p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span id=\"Distribution\">Distribution</span></h2>\n<p>The ashy drongo breeds in the hills of tropical southern Asia from eastern Afghanistan east to southern China, Ryukyu Islands in southern Japan (particularly Okinawa) and Indonesia. Many populations in the northern part of its range are migratory. Charles Vaurie described subspecies <i>beavani</i> (after Robert Cecil Beavan) as the population that breeds along the Himalayas that wintered in peninsular India. However, later workers include this as part of <i>longicaudatus</i> which also has a population that breeds in central India. In winter, the species is particularly fond of hill forests. E. C. Stuart Baker described <i>stevensi</i> which Vaurie considered as being either <i>beavani</i> or <i>hopwoodi</i> of the eastern Himalayas. To the east of the range of <i>hopwoodi</i> is <i>mouhouti</i> of Thailand and Myanmar. To the north of this range are <i>leucogenis</i> and <i>salangensis</i> (both migratory mainly to areas further south but also known from Nagaland) while <i>bondi</i> is found to the south. Along the southeast Asian island chain, there are number of insular populations including <i>periophthalmus</i>, <i>ryukyuensis</i>, <i>batakensis</i>, <i>phaedrus</i>, <i>siberu</i> and <i>nigrescens</i>. The nominate form is said to be found on Simalur, Java, Bali, Lombok, Palawan, and Balabac Islands.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Behaviour_and_ecology\">Behaviour and ecology</span></h2>\n<p>The ashy drongo has short legs and sits very upright while perched prominently, often high on a tree. It is insectivorous and forages by making aerial sallies but sometimes gleans from tree trunks. They are found singly, in pairs or small groups. During migration they fly in small flocks.</p><p>A common call that they make is described as <i>drangh gip</i> or <i>gip-gip-drangh</i>. They can imitate the calls of other birds and are capable of imitating the whistling notes of a common iora.</p><p>The breeding season is May to June with a clutch of three or four reddish or brown eggs laid in a loose cup nest in a tree.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n\n<h2><span id=\"External_links\">External links</span></h2>\n<ul><li>Ashy drongo videos, photos &amp; sounds on the Internet Bird Collection</li></ul> "

This prinia is a resident breeder in the Indian Subcontinent, ranging across most of India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Sri Lanka and western Myanmar. It is a common bird in urban gardens and farmland in many parts of India and its small size, distinctive colours and upright tail make it easy to identify. The northern populations have a rufous rump and back and have a distinct breeding and non-breeding plumage while other populations lack such variation.\n</p>\n\n\n<h2><span id=\"Description\">Description</span></h2>\n\n<p>These 13\u201314\u00a0cm long warblers have short rounded wings and longish graduated cream tail tipped with black subterminal spots. The tail is usually held upright and the strong legs are used for clambering about and hopping on the ground. They have a short black bill. The crown is grey and the underparts are rufous in most plumages. In breeding plumage, adults of the northern population are ash grey above, with a black crown and cheek with no supercilium and coppery brown wings. In non-breeding season, this population has a short and narrow white supercilium and the tail is longer. They are found singly or in pairs in shrubbery and will often visit the ground.</p><p>In winter, the northern subspecies, <i> P. s. stewartii</i> Blyth, 1847, has warm brown upperparts and a longer tail and has seasonal variation in plumage. The other races retain summer plumage all year round. West Bengal and eastwards has race <i>inglisi</i> Whistler &amp; Kinnear, 1933 which is darker slaty above than the nominate race of the Peninsula and deeper rufous on the flanks with a finer and shorter beak. The distinctive endemic race in Sri Lanka, <i> P. s. brevicauda</i> Legge, 1879, has a shorter tail and has the juveniles with yellowish underparts apart from a distinct call.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Distribution_and_habitat\">Distribution and habitat</span></h2>\n<p>This passerine bird is found in dry open grassland, open woodland, scrub and in home gardens in many cities. The northern limits of the species are along the Himalayan foothills extending into the upper Indus river system. The species is absent from the dry desert zone of the west of India and extends east into Burma. The Sri Lankan population is found mainly in the lowlands but going up into the hills to about 1600 m.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Behaviour_and_ecology\">Behaviour and ecology</span></h2>\n<p>Like most warblers, the ashy prinia is insectivorous. The song is a repetitive <i>tchup, tchup, tchup</i> or <i>zeet-zeet-zeet</i>. Another call is a nasal <i>tee-tee-tee</i>. It also makes a sound like \"electric sparks\" during its fluttery flight, which is thought to be produced by the wings (however, one author suggests that it is made by the beak).</p>\n<blockquote class=\"templatequote\"><p>\nIt is most easily distinguished by the loud snapping noise it makes during flight. How this noise is produced we do not know for certain. Reid was of opinion that the bird snapped its long tail. What exactly this means I do not know. Jesse believes that the sound is produced by the bird's mandibles. I have spent much time in watching the bird, and am inclined to think that the noise is caused by the beating of the wings against the tail. This last is constantly being wagged and jerked, and it seems to me that the wings beat against it as the bird flits about. When doves and pigeons fly, their wings frequently meet, causing a flapping sound. I am of opinion that something similar occurs when the ashy wren-warbler takes to its wings.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>The non-migratory genus <i>Prinia</i> shows biannual moult, which is rare among passerines. A moult occurs in spring (April to May) and another moult occurs in autumn (October to November). Biannual moult is theorized to be favoured when ectoparasite loads are very high, however no investigations have been made. <i>Prinia socialis</i> moults some remiges twice a year and is termed to have a partially biannual moult, however some authors describe <i>P. socialis socialis</i> as having two complete moults.</p><p>Birds stay in pairs but roost singly on the branch of a small tree or shrub.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Breeding\">Breeding</span></h3>\n<p>The song is sung from the top of a bush and males make fluttery display flights with the tail held up. The ashy prinia builds its nest close to the ground in a shrub or tall grass. Several types of nests have been described, including a flimsy cup made by sewing several large leaves, an oblong purse-like structure with grass stems inside it, and a flimsy ball of grass. The usual nest is built low in a bush and consists of leaves stitched together with webs, lined with hair and having an entrance on the side. It lays 3 to 5 glossy, somewhat oval-shaped eggs. They vary in colour from brick-red to rich chestnut. The broad end of the egg is generally darker than the remainder of the shell, and exhibits a cap or zone. The eggs measure 0.6 to 0.68 inches in length, and 0.45 to 0.5 in breadth. They hatch in about 12 days.</p><p>The breeding season varies with locality and has been recorded around the year, but mostly after the monsoons. In north India it is mainly June to September and in Sri Lanka mainly December to March or August to October. Breeding season is during May to June in the Nilgiris. The species is believed to be monogamous, and both the male and the female take part in incubation and feeding, though to varying extents. Parents may spend more time at the nest during cool days. The eggs hatch in about 12 days. Plaintive and grey-bellied cuckoos are known to be brood parasites of this species. When the nest is threatened by predators such as cats, adults have been observed feigning injury.</p><p>Rare cases of birds reusing material from a nest to build a nest at a new location have been noted.</p>\n\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n\n<h2><span id=\"Other_sources\">Other sources</span></h2>\n<ul><li>Balachandran, S; Rosalind, Lima (1992) Southern Ashy Wren-Warbler <i>Prinia socialis socialis</i> Sykes in Pt.

Several birds may sit huddled side-by-side on the bare branches of a tall tree, sometimes preening each other. They also perch on high vantage points such as powerlines and pylons. From their perches, they make aerial sallies, flapping and gliding to capture insects in the air. Insects may be caught in the beak, transferred and held in their feet, torn up with their bill and swallowed without returning to the perch. They may also return to the perch with prey to feed and will sometimes sit on the ground and have been known to visit bird baths. Although mainly feeding on insects, they may take nectar from flowers of trees such as <i>Erythrina</i>. They have been recorded feeding on toxic butterflies of the family Danaiidae such as <i>Euploea core</i> which are avoided by other birds.</p><p>The breeding season in India is March to June, the nest is a shallow cup placed at some height such as at the base of the frond of a tall palm or a hollow atop a street lighting post. The usual clutch consists of 2\u20133 greenish white eggs with brown spots. Both parents take part in nest building, incubation and feeding the young. They will mob larger birds such as crows and birds of prey that approach too close to the nesting birds. The song consists of a varied combination of wheezy notes that may include imitations of the calls of other birds. The usual call is shrill nasal <i>chewk</i>.</p><p>They make seasonal movements, possibly in response to rainfall.</p><p>The woodswallows, Artamidae, are among the few perching birds that have special feathers called powder down that break up into fine dust that is spread by the birds onto their body when preening.

This species is the smallest \"true quail\", ranging in the wild from southeastern Asia to Oceania with 10 different subspecies. A failed attempt was made to introduce this species to New Zealand by the Otago Acclimatisation Society in the late 1890s. It is quite common in aviculture worldwide, where it is sometimes misleadingly known as the \"<b>button quail</b>\", which is the name of an only very distantly related family of birds, the buttonquails.\n</p>\n\n\n<h2><span id=\"Description\">Description</span></h2>\n<p>The male king quail comes in many colors, including blue, brown, silver, maroon, dark brown &amp; almost black. They have orange feet which are hard and able to withstand a continuous life on the ground like many other game birds. The female is similar to the male but cannot come in shades of blue. They can live up to 13 years in captivity but only 3-6 on average.  In the wild they may live only 1.5 years. The eggs of king quail are a light, creamy-brown colour and slightly pointed at the 'top'; roughly ovular in shape.\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Taxonomy\">Taxonomy</span></h2>\n<p>There are six subspecies recognized:</p>\n<ul><li><i>E. c. chinensis</i> <small>(Linnaeus, 1766)</small>: Found from India and Sri Lanka to Malaya, Indochina, southeastern China and Taiwan</li>\n<li><b>Nicobar blue-breasted quail</b> (<i>E. c. trinkutensis</i> <small>Richmond, 1902</small>): Found on Andaman and Nicobar Islands</li>\n<li><i>E. c. lineata</i> <small>(Scopoli, 1786)</small>: Found in the Philippines, Borneo, Lesser Sundas, Sulawesi and Sula Islands</li>\n<li><i>E. c. lepida</i> <small>Hartlaub, 1879</small>: Found in the Bismarck Archipelago</li>\n<li><i>E. c. australis</i> <small>Gould, 1865</small>: Found in eastern Australia</li>\n<li><i>E. c. colletti</i> <small>Mathews, 1912</small>: Found in northern Australia</li></ul><h2><span id=\"Reproduction\">Reproduction</span></h2>\n\n<p>Clutch size varies anywhere from 5 to 13 eggs. Before incubation starts all the eggs composing the clutch will be laid. In captivity, the ideal number of eggs in a clutch is 6 to 8. The chicks hatch after about 16 days.\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Conservation_status\">Conservation status</span></h2>\n<h3><span id=\"Australia\">Australia</span></h3>\n<p>King quail are not listed as threatened on the Australian Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999.\n</p>\n<h4><span id=\"State_of_Victoria.2C_Australia\"></span><span id=\"State_of_Victoria,_Australia\">State of Victoria, Australia</span></h4>\n<p>This species is listed as threatened on the Victorian Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act (1988). Under this Act, an <i>Action Statement</i> for the recovery and future management of this species has not been prepared.</p><p>On the 2007 advisory list of threatened vertebrate fauna in Victoria, this species is listed as endangered.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Aviculture\">Aviculture</span></h2>\n<p>This quail has been very popular to keep and breed for many years; numerous mutations have been developed. They are quite hardy once they have adjusted to their surroundings and will keep the bottom of an aviary spotless. A great advantage of these quails is that they will live exclusively on the ground, &amp; will not interfere with other birds. The cost of purchasing and maintaining them is very little. They have been known to become hand-tame.\n</p><p>They may be housed in pairs to quartets in a planted aviary, kept singly in bird cages, or in colonies in large flights. Males may compete, as may females. Suspension cages do not work well for this species of quail because of their smaller feet; a much finer size floor wire would need to be employed.</p><p>Females will lay an egg a day if kept on the proper diet. Nesting sites can be as spartan as a quiet corner or a depression in the ground against a wall. Preferably, a clump of long grass, tea tree branches, or pile of loose herbage should be provided. Often a hen will lay eggs on the aviary floor without the use of a nest. This is a sign that the birds are not content with the existing facilities and the provision of a sheltered nest site may result in a nest being built. The cock usually selects the nest site. The nest is a simple scrape in the ground, lined with grasses  and is built by the hen with some assistance from the cock. The eggs measuring 25 x 19mm are variable in colour form the palest of browns to dark olive and peppered with fine black spots. Clutch size varies from 4-13, but occasionally a hen will be found incubating upwards of 20 eggs. It is usually a combined clutch from a number of hens and due to the difficulties of turning and covering a clutch of that size, hatchability is often poor. It may be better to remove some of the eggs and artificially incubate them or foster them.</p><p>The species usually breed year round; incubation times are from 18\u201323 days before chicks hatch. The hen bird will care for the chicks until around 4 weeks of age where they should be separated from parent birds into a separate aviary. \n</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Hybrids_and_mutations\">Hybrids and mutations</span></h3>\n<p>Hybrids of king quail and brown quail are known.\n</p><p>Silvers and cinnamon are the most common colour varieties. Pied, albino, and charcoals are becoming more common. Mutations can be combined.\n</p><p>Occasional cock-feathered hens appear: This is not a mutation as such, but one of a few conditions which has affected normal hormonal balances. It is most often seen when a hen has an ovarian cyst, or growth. They usually stop laying eggs, but can live for a number of years happily just looking like a male. In one case a silver hen was kept for many years by herself, moulted into cock plumage, and laid only extremely pale green shelled eggs for a few seasons before passing of old age.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Diet\">Diet</span></h2>\n<p>In the wild, the diet of king quails consists of small bugs, seed and various grasses that are available at the time. In aviculture, all birds should be fed a variety of seeds as well as a healthy range of fruit and vegetables. During breeding, hens should be fed calcium-rich food sources such as shell grit to prevent egg binding. Newly hatched chicks should be fed high protein chick crumb mixed in with a little water. Other sources of protein include mealworms and various bugs.\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n\n<h2><span id=\"External_links\">External links</span></h2>\n<ul><li>BirdLife Species Factsheet</li>\n<li>ITIS Standard Report Page: Coturnix chinensis taxonomic details (includes subspecies)</li></ul> "

Several populations have been designated as subspecies:</p>\n<ul><li><i>M. o. viridissimus</i> is found from Senegal to northern Ethiopia (has more green on the throat, crown and nape with long streamers)</li>\n<li><i>M. o. cleopatra</i> from the Nile Valley to northern Sudan</li>\n<li><i>M. o. flavoviridis</i> from northern Chad to Sudan</li>\n<li><i>M. o. muscatensis</i> on the Arabian plateau (more yellowish green with narrow gorget on throat)</li>\n<li><i>M. o. cyanophrys</i> found in Israel and the Arabian region (includes <i>meccanus</i>)</li>\n<li><i>M. o. beludschicus</i>(=<i>M. o. biludschicus</i>) Iran to Pakistan (paler colours with a blue throat)</li>\n<li><i>M. o. orientalis</i> in India and Sri Lanka (has head and neck tinged with rufous).</li>\n<li><i>M. o. ferrugeiceps</i> (=<i>birmanus</i>) in northeastern India, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam (has rufous crown, mane and mantle). I</li>\n<li><i>M. o. ceylonicus</i> in Sri Lanka has the nape and hindneck with more pronounced golden brown sheen often included within the nominate race</li></ul><p>A study of species within the genus <i>Merops</i> based on plumage characteristics found that most of the subspecies of <i>M. o. orientalis</i> grouping together with the most similar species being <i>Merops leschenaulti</i> and subspecies <i>M. o. ferrugeiceps</i> appeared closer to that group.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Description\">Description</span></h2>\n\n<p>Like other bee-eaters, this species is a richly coloured, slender bird. It is about 9\u00a0inches (16\u201318\u00a0cm) long with about 2\u00a0inches made up by the elongated central tail-feathers. The sexes are not visually distinguishable. The entire plumage is bright green and tinged with blue especially on the chin and throat. The crown and upper back are tinged with golden rufous. The flight feathers are rufous washed with green and tipped with blackish. A fine black line runs in front of and behind the eye. The iris is crimson and the bill is black while the legs are dark grey. The feet are weak with the three toes joined at the base. Southeast Asian birds have rufous crown and face, and green underparts, whereas Arabian <i>beludschicus</i> has a green crown, blue face and bluish underparts. The wings are green and the beak is black. The elongated tail feathers are absent in juveniles. Sexes are alike.</p><p>The calls is a nasal trill <i>tree-tree-tree-tree</i>, usually given in flight.</p><p>Leucistic individuals have been noted.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Distribution_and_habitat\">Distribution and habitat</span></h2>\n<p>This is an abundant and fairly tame bird, familiar throughout its range. It is a bird which breeds in open country with bushes. In Africa and Arabia it is found in arid areas, but is more diverse in its habitats further east.  This species often hunts from low perches, maybe only a metre or less high. It readily makes use of fence wires and electric wires. Unlike some other bee-eaters, they can be found well away from water.</p><p>They are mostly seen in the plains but can sometimes be found up to 5000 or 6000 feet in the Himalayas. They are resident in the lowlands of South Asia but some populations move seasonally but the patterns are not clear, moving away to drier regions in the rainy season and to warmer regions in winter. In parts of Pakistan, they are summer visitors.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Behaviour_and_ecology\">Behaviour and ecology</span></h2>\n\n<p>Like other species in the genus, bee-eaters predominantly eat insects, especially bees, wasps and ants, which are caught in the air by sorties from an open perch. Before swallowing prey, a bee-eater removes stings and breaks the exoskeleton of the prey by repeatedly thrashing it on the perch. Migration is not known but they make seasonal movements in response to rainfall. These birds are somewhat sluggish in the mornings and may be found huddled next to each other on wires sometimes with their bills tucked in their backs well after sunrise. They sand-bathe more frequently than other bee-eater species and will sometimes bathe in water by dipping into water in flight. They are usually seen in small groups and often roost communally in large numbers (200-300). The birds move excitedly at the roost site and call loudly, often explosively dispersing before settling back to the roost tree.\nThe little green bee-eater is also becoming common in urban and sub-urban neighborhoods, and has been observed perching on television antennae, only to launch into a brief, zig-zag flight formation to catch an insect, then return to the same perch and consume the meal. This behaviour is generally observed between the hours of 7:00 and 8:00am, and after 4:00pm.\n</p>\n\n<p>The breeding season is from March to June. Unlike many bee-eaters, these are often solitary nesters, making a tunnel in a sandy bank. The breeding pairs are often joined by helpers. They nest in hollows in vertical mud banks. The nest tunnel that they construct can run as much as 5 feet long and the 3-5 eggs are laid on the bare ground in the cavity at the end of the tunnel. The eggs are very spherical and glossy white. Clutch size varies with rainfall and insect food density. Both sexes incubate. The eggs hatch asynchronously with an incubation period of about 14 days and the chicks grow fledge in 3 to 4 weeks and in the fledging stage show a reduction in body weight.from Sde Boker, Israel|left]]A study suggested that green bee-eaters may be capable of interpreting the behaviour of human observers. They showed an ability to predict whether a human at a particular location would be capable of spotting the nest entrance and then behaved appropriately to avoid giving away the nest location. The ability to look at a situation from another's point of view was previously believed to be possessed only by primates.</p><p>Riverside habitats were found to support high populations in southern India (157 birds per square kilometre) dropping off too 101 per km\u00b2 in agricultural areas and 43-58 per square km near human habitations.</p><p>They feed on flying insects and can sometimes be nuisance to bee-keepers. The preferred prey was mostly beetles followed by hymenopterans. Orthopterans appear to be avoided. They are sometimes known to take crabs. Like most other birds they regurgitate the hard parts of their prey as pellets.</p><p>An endoparasitic nematode (<i>Torquatoides balanocephala</i>) sometimes infects their gizzard. A protozoal parasite in their blood, <i>Haemoproteus manwelli</i>, has been described from India.</p>\n<ul class=\"gallery mw-gallery-packed\"><li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 272px\">\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 485.33333333333px\">\n</ul><h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n\n<h2><span id=\"External_links\">External links</span></h2>\n<ul><li>Internet Bird Collection</li></ul>\n<p>Template:Https://youtu.be/5q7TMPFOTz4\n</p> "

        "details": "<p class=\"mw-empty-elt\">\n\n</p>\n<p>The <b>Asian house martin</b> (<i>Delichon dasypus</i>) is a migratory passerine bird of the swallow family Hirundinidae. It has mainly blue-black upperparts, other than its white rump, and has pale grey underparts. Its three subspecies breed in the Himalayas and in central and eastern Asia, and spend the winter lower in the mountains or in Southeast Asia. This species is locally abundant and is expanding northward in Siberia, so there are no concerns about its conservation status.\n</p><p>This martin breeds in colonies, building mud nests under an overhang on a vertical cliff or the wall of a building. Both sexes build the nest, incubate the three or four white eggs and feed the chicks. The Asian house martin feeds on small insects taken in flight, usually caught high in the air. The presence of terrestrial springtails and Lepidoptera larvae in its diet indicates that food is sometime picked from the ground.\n</p>\n\n\n<h2><span id=\"Taxonomy\">Taxonomy</span></h2>\n<p>The Asian house martin was first formally described from a bird collected in Borneo by French naturalist and ornithologist Charles Lucien Bonaparte in 1850 as <i>Chelidon dasypus</i>, shortly before it was moved to the new genus <i>Delichon</i> by British entomologist Frederic Moore and American naturalist Thomas Horsfield in 1854. <i>Delichon</i> is an anagram of the Ancient Greek term <i>\u03c7\u03b5\u03bb\u03b9\u03b4\u03ce\u03bd</i> (<i>chel\u012bd\u014dn</i>), meaning \"swallow\", and <i>dasypus</i> is from Greek <i>\u03b4\u03b1\u03c3\u03cd\u03c0\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2</i> \"rough-legged\". This martin's closest relatives are the two other members of the genus <i>Delichon</i>, the Nepal house martin and the common house martin.\nThere are three subspecies:</p>\n<ul><li><i>D. d. dasypus</i>, the nominate subspecies described by Bonaparte, which breeds in eastern Russia and nearby islands</li>\n<li><i>D. d. cashmeriensis</i>, the Himalayan and central Asian form described by English ornithologist John Gould in 1858 from a Kashmiri specimen obtained by Andrew Leith Adams</li>\n<li><i>D. d. nigrimentalis</i>, the form which is found in the south east of the breeding range, was described by German ornithologist Ernst Hartert in 1910 from a specimen taken in Fujian, southeast China.</li></ul>\n<h2><span id=\"Description\">Description</span></h2>\n<p>The adult Asian house martin of the nominate subspecies is 12\u00a0cm (4.7\u00a0in) long, dark steel blue above with a contrasting white rump, grey-washed white underparts, and a slightly forked tail. The tail and upperwings are brownish-black, and the underwings are grey-brown. The legs and feet are brownish-pink and covered with white feathers, the eyes are brown, and the bill is black. There are few differences in appearance between the sexes, although the male is somewhat whiter below than the female, especially in fresh plumage. The juvenile bird is less glossy and has dark brown upperparts, sometimes with a brownish wash to the rump, and grey-white underparts.</p><p><i>D. d. cashmiriensis</i> has brighter blue upperparts and a whiter rump than the slightly larger nominate race. The third, smallest, race is <i>D. d. nigrimentalis</i>.  All three subspecies can be distinguished from the similar Nepal house martin by the latter species' black chin, black undertail coverts and much squarer tail. The Asian house martin is more similar to the common house martin, but is darker underneath and has a less deeply forked tail. Confusion is most likely between adult male Asian house martins, which have paler underparts, and the eastern race of common house martin, <i>D. urbicum lagopodum</i> which has a less forked tail than the western subspecies, although it still shows a more pronounced fork than Asian.</p><p>This species\u2019 song is a rippling metallic trill, and is a sibilant twitter, and call is a dry metallic cheep, often with two or three syllables. It is similar to that of common house martin, but more rasping.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Distribution_and_habitat\">Distribution and habitat</span></h2>\n<p>The nominate subspecies of the Asian house martin, <i>D. d. dasypus</i>, breeds in the southeast of Russia, the Kuril Islands, Japan and sometimes Korea. It migrates through eastern China to winter in the Malay Peninsula, Borneo, the Philippines, Java and Sumatra; a few birds remain around hot springs in Japan. <i>D. d. cashmeriensis</i> breeds in the Himalayas from Afghanistan east to Sikkim and northwards into Tibet and western and central China. It is found between 1,500\u20135,000\u00a0m (4,900\u201316,400\u00a0ft) altitude, although mainly in the 2,400\u20134,000\u00a0m (7,900\u201313,100\u00a0ft) range. This martin is a short-range migrant, mainly wintering at lower altitudes in the foothills of the Himalayas, but with some birds on the plains of North-eastern India and North-eastern and South-eastern Bangladesh, and smaller numbers further afield in Myanmar and northern Thailand. The third race, <i>D. d. nigrimentalis</i>, breeds in southeastern China and southern Siberia. Its wintering grounds are unknown, but birds in Taiwan just move to lower altitudes in winter. Non-breeding Asian house martin have been recorded as far west as the United Arab Emirates. The range of <i>D. d. cashmeriensis</i> overlaps with that of the Nepal house martin, although they breed at somewhat different altitudes. The height separation and the small differences in appearance seem sufficient to prevent interbreeding.</p><p>The preferred habitat of the Asian house martin is valleys and gorges in mountainous areas or coastal cliffs, where natural caves or crevices provide nest sites. It will also breed on large man-made sites like temples, hotels or power stations. This martin tends to move to lower altitude open or hilly country in its wintering areas, although it has been recorded at up to 2,565\u00a0m (8,415\u00a0ft) in Thailand.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Behaviour\">Behaviour</span></h2>\n<h3><span id=\"Breeding\">Breeding</span></h3>\n\n<p>The Asian house martin is a cliff nester, breeding in colonies sited under an overhang on a vertical cliff, usually with the nests not touching. It also frequently nests on large buildings such as temples and bridges, but not to the same extent as the common house martin. The nest is a deep mud cone lined with grasses or feathers. Unlike its relatives, the Asian house martin frequently does not complete the enclosure of its nest, leaving it open instead like a deeper version of a barn swallow nest. A Russian study found half the nests in its Baikal research area to be of the open type, and the Himalayan subspecies <i>D. d. cashmiriensis</i> has also been recorded as building a shallow cup nest.</p><p>The normal clutch is three or four (occasionally up to six) plain white eggs averaging 20.2\u00a0mm \u00d7\u00a014.1\u00a0mm (0.80\u00a0in \u00d7\u00a00.56\u00a0in) and weighing 2.1\u00a0g (0.074\u00a0oz). The incubation and fledging times are unknown, but are probably similar to those of the common house martin, which has an incubation period of 14 to 16 days until the eggs hatch, and a further 22 to 32 days to fledging. Both sexes build the nest, incubate the eggs and feed the chicks.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Feeding\">Feeding</span></h3>\n<p>This martin feeds on insects taken in flight. As with its relatives it tends to feed high in the air, taking mostly small flies, aphid and Hymenoptera such as winged ants. A wide range of other insects are caught, including Lepidoptera, beetles and lacewings. The presence in the diet of terrestrial springtails and Lepidoptera larvae indicate that food is sometime picked from the ground.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Predators_and_parasites\">Predators and parasites</span></h3>\n<p>Birds often carry parasites, both external lice and fleas, and internal blood parasites. The Asian house martin is a host of the house martin flea <i>Ceratophyllus hirundinis</i>, and has recently been shown to carry signs of avian malaria. The predators of this martin appear to be little studied, but are presumably similar to those of the common house martin, namely fast flying falcons such as Oriental hobby which can chase down their prey in flight.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Conservation_status\">Conservation status</span></h2>\n<p>The Asian house martin has a large range that does not appear to be contracting, and its numbers appear to be stable, although the total population is unknown. Since the range is more than 20,000 square kilometres (7,700\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), and there are more 10,000 mature individuals, in the absence of any large decline in distribution or numbers the species does not appear to meet the criteria to be considered vulnerable, and is currently evaluated as Least Concern. This species is locally abundant and appears to be expanding its range northwards in southern Siberia.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n\n<h2><span id=\"External_links\">External links</span></h2> "

        "details": "<p class=\"mw-empty-elt\">\n\n</p>\n<p>The <b>Asian openbill</b> or <b>Asian openbill stork</b> (<i>Anastomus oscitans</i>) is a large wading bird in the stork family Ciconiidae. This distinctive stork is found mainly in the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia. It is greyish or white with glossy black wings and tail and the adults have a gap between the arched upper mandible and recurved lower mandible. Young birds are born without this gap which is thought to be an adaptation that aids in the handling of snails, their main prey. Although resident within their range, they make long distance movements in response to weather and food availability.\n</p>\n\n\n<h2><span id=\"Taxonomy\">Taxonomy</span></h2>\n<p>The Asian openbill was described by the French polymath Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon in 1780 in his <i>Histoire Naturelle des Oiseaux</i> from a specimen collected in Pondichery, India. The bird was also illustrated in a hand-coloured plate engraved by Fran\u00e7ois-Nicolas Martinet in the <i>Planches Enlumin\u00e9es D'Histoire Naturelle</i> which was produced under the supervision of Edme-Louis Daubenton to accompany Buffon's text.  Neither the plate caption nor Buffon's description included a scientific name but in 1783 the Dutch naturalist Pieter Boddaert coined the binomial name <i>Ardea oscitans</i> in his catalogue of the <i>Planches Enlumin\u00e9es</i>. The Asian openbill is now placed in the genus <i>Anastomus</i> that was erected by the French naturalist Pierre Bonnaterre in 1791. The genus name <i>Anastomus</i> is from the Ancient Greek \u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03bc\u03bf\u03c9 <i>anastomo\u014d</i> meaning \"to furnish with a mouth\" or \"with mouth wide-opened\". The specific epithet <i>oscitans</i> is the Latin word for \"yawning\".</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Description\">Description</span></h2>\n\n<p>The Asian openbill stork is predominantly greyish (non-breeding season) or white (breeding season) with glossy black wings and tail that have a green or purple sheen. The name is derived from the distinctive gap formed between the recurved lower and arched upper mandible of the beak in adult birds. Young birds do not have this gap. The cutting edges of the mandible have a fine brush like structure that is thought to give them better grip on the shells of snails. The tail consists of twelve feathers and the preen gland has a tuft. The mantle is black and the bill is horn-grey. At a distance, they can appear somewhat like a white stork or Oriental stork. The short legs are pinkish to grey, reddish prior to breeding. Non-breeding birds have a smoky grey wings and back instead of white. Young birds are brownish-grey and have a brownish mantle. Like other storks, the Asian openbill is a broad-winged soaring bird, which relies on moving between thermals of hot air for sustained flight. They are usually found in flocks but single birds are not uncommon. Like all storks, it flies with its neck outstretched. It is relatively small for a stork and stands at 68\u00a0cm height (81\u00a0cm long).</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Habitat_and_distribution\">Habitat and distribution</span></h2>\n<p>The usual foraging habitats are inland wetlands and are only rarely seen along river banks and tidal flats. On agricultural landscapes, birds forage in crop fields, irrigation canals, and in seasonal marshes. Birds may move widely in response to habitat conditions. Young birds also disperse widely after fledging. Individuals ringed at Bharatpur in India have been recovered 800\u00a0km east and a bird ringed in Thailand has been recovered 1500\u00a0km west in Bangladesh. Storks are regularly disoriented by lighthouses along the southeast coast of India on overcast nights between August and September. The species is very rare in the Sind and Punjab regions of Pakistan, but widespread and common in India, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Thailand and Cambodia.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Food_and_foraging\">Food and foraging</span></h2>\n\n<p>During the warmer part of the day, Asian Openbills soar on thermals and have a habit of descending rapidly into their feeding areas. Groups may forage together in close proximity in shallow water or marshy ground on which they may walk with a slow and steady gait. The Asian openbill feeds mainly on large molluscs, especially <i>Pila</i> species, and they separate the shell from the body of the snail using the tip of the beak. The tip of the lower mandible of the beak is often twisted to the right. This tip is inserted into the opening of the snail and the body is extracted with the bill still under water. Jerdon noted that they were able to capture snails even when blindfolded. The exact action being difficult to see, led to considerable speculation on the method used. Sir Julian Huxley examined the evidence from specimens and literature and came to the conclusion that the bill gap was used like a nutcracker. He held the rough edges of the bill as being the result of wear and tear from such actions. Subsequent studies have dismissed this idea and the rough edge of the bill has been suggested as being an adaptation to help handle hard and slippery shells. They forage for prey by holding their bill tips slightly apart and make rapid vertical jabs in shallow water often with the head and neck partially submerged. The gap in the bill is not used for handling snail shells and forms only with age. Young birds that lack a gap are still able to forage on snails. It has been suggested that the gap allows the tips to strike at a greater angle to increases the force that the tips can apply on snail shells. Smaller snails are often swallowed whole or crushed.  They also feed on water snakes, frogs and large insects. When foraging on agricultural landscapes with a variety of habitats, Asian openbills preferentially use natural marshes and lakes (especially in the monsoon and winter), and irrigation canals (especially in the summer) as foraging habitat.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Breeding\">Breeding</span></h2>\n\n<p>The breeding season is after the rains, during July to September in northern India and Nepal, and November to March in southern India and Sri Lanka. They may skip breeding in drought years. The Asian openbill breeds colonially, building a rough platform of sticks often on half-submerged trees (often <i>Barringtonia</i>, <i>Avicennia</i> and <i>Acacia</i> species), typically laying two to four eggs. The nesting trees are either shared with those of egrets, cormorants and darters, or can be single-species colonies like in lowland Nepal. Nesting colonies are sometimes in highly disturbed areas such as inside villages and on trees located in crop fields. In lowland Nepal, 13 colonies found in an agricultural landscape had an average colony size of 52, ranging from 5 nests to 130 nests. The majority of these colonies were located on <i>Bombax ceiba</i> trees, with much fewer located on <i>Ficus religiosa</i> and <i>Dalbergia sissoo</i> tree species. Asian openbills preferred trees that were much taller and bigger than trees that were available on the landscape, and selectively used wild and native tree species entirely avoiding species that were important for resources such as fruits (e.g. <i>Mangifera indica</i>) despite such trees being much more common. Religious beliefs have secured important trees such as <i>Ficus</i> species, and agro-forestry has secured the most preferred species, <i>Bombax ceiba</i>, that Asian openbills prefer to locate colonies in lowland Nepal. The nests are close to each other leading to considerable aggressive interactions between birds on neighbouring nests. Both parents take turns in incubation, the eggs hatching after about 25 days. The chicks emerge with cream coloured down and are shaded by the loosely outspread and drooped wings of a parent.</p><p>Initiation of nests in lowland Nepal was highly synchronized, with colonies started during July and August. Breeding success at nests in these colonies was impacted by proximity of colonies to human habitation, and the progression of the breeding season. Colonies closer to human habitation had lower success, and colonies initiated later during the breeding season (when flooding of the rice fields had reduced to allow ripening of the crop) had lower success. Number of chicks that fledged from colonies located on trees in agricultural landscapes in lowland Nepal were similar to that observed in a protected, mangrove reserve in eastern India suggesting that agricultural areas are not always detrimental to large waterbirds such as Asian openbills.</p><p>Nesting openbills in Nepal took an average of 27 minutes to return to nests with food for nestlings and fledglings. The time taken to find food was most impacted by the location of wetlands around colonies, and the progression of the breeding season. Adults look the least time to return with food earlier in the season when the dominant rice crop was most flooded, and time increased as the rice ripened along with the drying out of the fields.</p><p>Like other storks, they are silent except for clattering produced by the striking of the male's bill against that of the female during copulation. They also produce low honking notes accompanied by up and down movements of the bill when greeting a partner arriving at the nest. Males may sometimes form polygynous associations, typically with two females which may lay their eggs in the same nest.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Relationship_with_other_organisms\">Relationship with other organisms</span></h2>\n<p>Young birds at the nest are sometimes preyed on by imperial, steppe and greater spotted eagles. <i>Chaunocephalus ferox</i>, an intestinal parasite, is a trematode worm found in about 80% of the wild populations in Thailand while another species <i>Echinoparyphium oscitansi</i> has been described from Asian openbills in Thailand. Other helminth parasites such as <i>Thapariella anastomusa</i>, <i>T. oesophagiala</i> and  <i>T. udaipurensis</i> have been described from the oesophagus of storks.</p><p>In colonial India, sportsmen shot the openbill for meat, calling it the \"beef-steak bird\" (although this name was also used for the woolly-necked stork).</p>\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n\n<h2><span id=\"External_links\">External links</span></h2>\n<ul><li>Asian Openbill (Anastomus oscitans) video photos and sounds - Internet Bird Collection</li>\n<li>Asian Openbill <i>Anastomus oscitans</i> - Adult - Oriental Bird Images</li></ul> "

They are usually found in small groups mainly on the plains and low foothills. They are often seen within cities and villages although they are not as bold as the common myna. They produce a range of calls made up of liquid notes. Several slight plumage variations exist in the populations and about five subspecies are named.\n</p>\n\n\n<h2><span id=\"Taxonomy\">Taxonomy</span></h2>\n\n<p>The species has been included in the genus <i>Sturnus</i> and <i>Sturnopastor</i> in the past but recent studies do not support its inclusion within <i>Sturnus</i> leading to the reinstatement of an older genus name <i>Gracupica</i>. It has been claimed that the species name \"contra\" is derived from an Indian name for it, although this has not been traced subsequently.</p>\n\n<p>The nominate subspecies (based on the species description given by Linnaeus in 1758) is found mainly along the Gangetic plains extending south into Andhra Pradesh and east to Bangladesh. The population in northeastern India (Sadiya to Tirap and the Naga Hills) was named as <i>sordida</i> (originally <i>Sturnus contra sordidus</i>) by Sidney Dillon Ripley in 1950. This form differs from the Indian form in having reduced streaking on the shoulders and nape. The populations in Manipur south to Myanmar and east to Yunnan have the white extending over the eye and are included in the subspecies <i>superciliaris</i> first described by Edward Blyth in 1863. The subspecies in Thailand, Laos and Cambodia is included in <i>floweri</i> ( Sharpe, 1897) while <i>jalla</i> described by Horsfield in 1821 is found on Sumatra, Java and Bali.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Description\">Description</span></h2>\n<p>This myna is strikingly marked in black and white and has a yellowish bill with a reddish bill base. The bare skin around the eye is reddish. The upper body, throat and breast are black while the cheek, lores, wing coverts and rump are contrastingly white. The sexes are similar in plumage but young birds have dark brown in place of black. The subspecies vary slightly in plumage, extent of streaking of the feathers and in measurements.\n</p><p>The flight is slow and butterfly-like on round wings.</p><p>Leucistic individuals have been recorded.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Distribution_and_habitat\">Distribution and habitat</span></h2>\n<p>The species is found mainly in the plains but in the foothills up to about 700m above sea level. They are found mainly in areas with access to open water. Their main distribution in India is from the Gangetic plains extending south to the Krishna River. Their range is increasing, with populations establishing more recently in Pakistan, Rajkot, and Bombay (since 1953), possibly aided by trade in caged birds and accidental escape. Their westerward spread in India particularly in parts of Rajasthan has been aided by changes in irrigation and farming patterns, and the spread into Sumatra has been aided by deforestation. The species has also established itself in Dubai, UAE.</p><p>The habitat is lowland open areas with scattered trees near water, often near human habitation. This species is often seen at sewage farms and refuse tips.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Behaviour\">Behaviour</span></h2>\n\n<p>These starlings are usually found in small groups, foraging mainly on the ground but perching on trees and buildings. Birds in a group call frequently with a wide repertoire that includes whistles, trills, buzzes, clicks, and warbling calls. Young birds taken into captivity have been trained to imitate tunes of other birds.\n</p><p>Both sexes sing. They forage in fields, lawns and on open ground feeding on grains, fruit, insects, earthworms and molluscs usually taken from the ground. Like many other starlings, they often use a prying or gaping action, piercing soil and then opening apart the bill to dislodge hidden food. The strong protractor muscles allow them to part a mat of grass and their eyes are positioned to obtain a binocular view of the space between the parted beak. They often feed in grazing land or among cattle.</p><p>The breeding season in India is spread from March to September. With the onset of breeding, the sizes of flocks decline and birds pair up. Courtship involves calling, fluffing of the feathers and head bobbing. The nest is a loose mass of straw formed into a dome with an entrance on the side and placed in a large tree (often banyan, mango, jackfruit, rosewood) or sometimes on man-made structures, often close to human habitation. Several pairs will breed in the same vicinity. The usual clutch is made up of about four to six glossy blue eggs. Each egg is laid with a day in between and incubation begins only after the third or fourth egg is laid. The eggs hatch after 14 to 15 days. The young are brooded for two weeks, the female staying at the nest during the night. Both parents feed the chicks until they fledge and leave after three weeks. More than one brood may be raised in a season.</p><p>An instance of interspecific feeding, where an adult of a common myna fed a young pied myna has been reported.</p><p>These mynas form communal roosts at night and jointly defend nesting areas.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"In_culture\">In culture</span></h2>\n<p>The ability of these mynas to mimic human voices made them popular as cagebirds. The Sema Nagas will not eat this bird as they believe it is the reincarnation of a human. They are considered to be generally beneficial because they eat many insects.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n\n<h2><span id=\"Other_sources\">Other sources</span></h2>\n<ul><li>Ray, D (1972) Pied Myna <i>Sturnus contra</i> in Delhi. <i>Newsletter for Birdwatchers</i>. 12(10):11.</li>\n<li>Narang, ML; Lamba, BS (1976) On the feeding-time and feeding-area preference of Indian Pied Myna, <i>Sturnus contra</i> Linn.

It breeds singly, or in small loose colonies. It is distributed in a wide variety of habitats including marshes in forests, agricultural areas, and freshwater wetlands.\n</p>\n\n\n<h2><span id=\"Taxonomy\">Taxonomy</span></h2>\n<p>The woolly-necked stork was described by the French polymath Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon in 1780 in his <i>Histoire Naturelle des Oiseaux</i> from a specimen collected from the Coromandel Coast of India. The bird was also illustrated in a hand-coloured plate engraved by Fran\u00e7ois-Nicolas Martinet in the <i>Planches Enlumin\u00e9es D'Histoire Naturelle</i> which was produced under the supervision of Edme-Louis Daubenton to accompany Buffon's text.  Neither the plate caption nor Buffon's description included a scientific name but in 1783 the Dutch naturalist Pieter Boddaert coined the binomial name <i>Ardea episcopus</i> in his catalogue of the <i>Planches Enlumin\u00e9es</i>. The woolly-necked stork is now placed in the genus <i>Ciconia</i> that was erected by the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson in 1760. The genus name <i>Ciconia</i> is the Latin word for a \"stork\"; the specific epithet <i>episcopus</i> is Latin for \"bishop\".</p><p>Three subspecies are recognised:</p>\n<ul><li><i>C. e. microscelis</i> Gray, GR, 1848 \u2013 Africa south of the Sahara</li>\n<li><i>C. e. episcopus</i> (Boddaert, 1783) \u2013 India to Indochina, the Philippines and Malay Peninsula, north Sumatra</li>\n<li><i>C. e. neglecta</i> (Finsch, 1904) \u2013 south Sumatra, Java, Lesser Sunda Islands, Sulawesi</li></ul><p>The online edition of the <i>Handbook of the Birds of the World</i> treats the African race, <i>C. e. microscelis</i>, as a separate species, the African woolyneck, with the remaining two subspecies becoming the Asian woolyneck.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Description\">Description</span></h2>\n<p>The woolly-necked stork is a medium-sized stork at 75\u201392\u00a0cm tall. The iris is deep crimson or wine-red. The stork is glistening black overall with a black \"skull cap\", a downy white neck which gives it its name. The lower belly and under-tail coverts are white, standing out from the rest of the dark coloured plumage. Feathers on the fore-neck are iridescent with a coppery-purple tinge. These feathers are elongated and can be erected during displays. The tail is deeply forked and is white, usually covered by the black long under tail coverts. It has long red legs and a heavy, blackish bill, though some specimens have largely dark-red bills with only the basal one-third being black. Sexes are alike. Juvenile birds are duller versions of the adult with a feathered forehead that is sometimes streaked black-and-white. The African birds are described as having the edges of the black cap diffused or with a jagged border compared to a sharp and clean border in the Asian birds. Sexes are identical, though males are thought to be larger. When the wings are opened either during displays or for flight, a narrow band of very bright unfeathered skin is visible along the underside of the forearm. This band has been variously described as being \"neon, orange-red\", \"like a red-gold jewel\", and \"almost glowing\" when seen at close range.</p><p>Small nestlings are pale grey with buffy down on the neck, and a black crown. At fledging age, the immature bird is identical to the adult except for a feathered forehead, much lesser iridescence on feathers, and much longer and fluffier feathers on the neck.</p><p>English common names for this species include Whitenecked Stork, Whiteheaded Stork, Bishop Stork, and the Parson-bird. More recently, the African and Asian populations are considered to be two different species, the African and the Asian Woolly-neck. This is based purely on geographical isolation, but there is no morphological or phylogenetic evidence yet to support this split.\n</p>\n\n\n<h2><span id=\"Distribution_and_habitat\">Distribution and habitat</span></h2>\n\n<p>It is a widespread tropical species which breeds in Asia, from India to Indonesia, and throughout Africa. It is a resident breeder building nests on trees located on agricultural fields or wetlands, on natural cliffs, and on cell phone towers. They use a variety of freshwater wetlands including seasonal and perennial reservoirs and marshes, crop lands, irrigation canals and rivers. They are attracted to fires in grasslands and crop fields where they capture insects trying to escape the fire. They use ponds and marshes inside forests in both Africa and Asia, especially in south-east Asia where they use grassy and marshy areas in clearings in evergreen rainforests. In India, they are an uncommon species in coastal habitats. They use coastal areas in Africa also, with birds in Sulawasi observed to be eating sea snakes, and birds on the Kenya coast foraging in coral reefs and mudflats. In an agricultural landscape in north India, woolly-necked storks preferred fallow fields during the summer and monsoon seasons, and natural freshwater wetlands during the winter. Here, irrigation canals were preferentially used during winters when water levels were low, and birds avoided crop fields in all seasons. Assisted by construction of new irrigation canals, this species is spreading to arid areas like the Thar Desert in Rajasthan, India.</p><p>Individuals of this species have been sighted at altitudes of 3,790 m above sea level in China (Napahai wetland), and 3,540 m above sea level in Nepal (Annapurna Conservation Area).</p>\n\n<h2><span id=\"Behavior\">Behavior</span></h2>\n\n<p>Several calls by adult birds have been described including bisyllabic whistles given along with displays at the nest, and a fierce hissing sound when a bird was attacked by a trained falcon. The woolly-necked stork is a broad winged soaring bird, which relies on moving between thermals of hot air for sustained long distance flight. Like all storks, it flies with its neck outstretched. It has also been observed to 'roll, tumble and dive at steep angles' in the air with the wind through its quills making a loud noise. Adult birds have also been observed diving from nests before flying away abruptly in a 'bat-like flight'.</p><p>This species is largely seen as single birds, in pairs, or in small family groups of 4\u20135, and flocks are uncommon. In agricultural landscapes, the species occurs mostly as very small flocks (&lt; 5 birds), though flocks of over 10 birds occur commonly. Flocking is affected by different factors in different areas. In more arid areas, most of the flocks occur in the summer when few wetlands are remaining, whereas in areas with more water, flocks occur largely in winter after chicks have fledged from nests. They often associate with wintering stork species including the Black and White Storks.</p>\n\n<h3><span id=\"Diet\">Diet</span></h3>\n<p>The woolly-necked stork walks slowly and steadily on the ground seeking its prey, which like that of most of its relatives, consists of amphibians, reptiles and insects.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Breeding\">Breeding</span></h3>\n<p>Typically, a large stick nest is built on a tree, and two to five eggs form the typical clutch, with five eggs being very rare. Birds commonly use both forest trees and solitary trees in agricultural areas to build nests. In India, nests are increasingly being observed in urban areas on cell phone towers. Riverside cliffs are also used occasionally as nest sites.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Conservation\">Conservation</span></h2>\n<p>The woolly-necked stork is one of the species to which the <i>Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds</i> (AEWA) applies.\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Different_views_.26_aspects\"></span><span id=\"Different_views_&amp;_aspects\">Different views &amp; aspects</span></h2>\n<ul class=\"gallery mw-gallery-traditional\" style=\"max-width: 815px;\"><li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\">\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\">\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\">\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\">\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\">\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\">\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\">\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\">\n</ul><h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n\n<ul><li><i>Birds of The Gambia</i> by Barlow, Wacher and Disley, <link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r951705291\">ISBN\u00a01-873403-32-1</li>\n<li><i>Birds of India</i> by Grimmett, Inskipp and Inskipp, <link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r951705291\">ISBN\u00a00-691-04910-6</li></ul><h2><span id=\"External_links\">External links</span></h2>\n<ul><li>Woolly-necked Stork <i>Ciconia episcopus</i> - BirdLife International</li>\n<li>Woolly-necked Stork videos and photos - Internet Bird Collection</li>\n<li>Woollynecked Stork - <i>The Atlas of Southern African Birds</i></li></ul> "

The females of Baer's pochard and the ferruginous duck are quite similar, but that holds true for the females of almost all <i>Aythya</i> species. Eclipse males resemble females, but retain the white eye.</p><p>Formerly classified as a vulnerable species by the IUCN, recent research shows that its numbers are decreasing more and more rapidly. It was consequently uplisted to endangered status in 2008. In 2012, it was further uplisted to critically endangered. Between 1987 and 2007, there were only eleven reports of groups of 100+ birds in mainland China. A recent census by World Wildlife Fund (WWF) China of Hubei province found just 131 individuals on Liangzihu Lake, and only another three flocks of ten, eight, and three individuals at other sites.

A molecular phylogentic study published in 2009 found that the genus <i>Anas</i> as then defined was non-monophyletic.  Based on this analysis the genus was split into four proposed genera with the Baikal teal placed in the resurrected genus <i>Sibirionetta</i> that had been introduced by the German zoologist Hans von Boetticher in 1929. The name <i>Sibirionetta</i> is derived from the Latin <i>sibiricus</i> for Siberia and the Ancient Greek <i>n\u0113tta</i> for a duck. The specific epithet <i>formosa</i> is from the Latin <i>formosus</i> for \"beautiful\".</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Description\">Description</span></h2>\n<p>At between 39 and 43 centimetres (15 and 17\u00a0in), this duck is slightly larger and longer-tailed than the common teal. The breeding male is unmistakable, with a striking green nape, yellow and black auriculars, neck, and throat. It has a dark crown, and its breast is light brown with dark spots. It has long dropping dark scapulars, and its grey sides are set off on the front and rear with white bars.\n</p><p>The Baikal teal has a height from 11.75 to 15.75 inches and a weighs an average of 1 pound.\n</p><p>The female looks similar to a female green-winged teal but with a longer tail, and a distinctive white spot at the base of the bill and a white throat that angles to the back of the eye. She also has a distinct light eyebrow bordered by a darker crown. The underwing is similar to the Green-winged Teal also, but has a darker leading edge.  The green speculum has an indistinct cinnamon-buff inner border. Some \"females\" have \"bridle\" markings on their faces, but it has been suggested that at least some of these bridled \"females,\" if not all, are in fact juvenile males. The juvenile has a plumage similar to that of the female and can be distinguished from the Common Teal by the pale loral spot.\n</p><p>In non-breeding (eclipse) plumage, the drake looks more like the female, but plumage is a much richer reddish-brown (rufous) colour.\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Distribution_and_habitat\">Distribution and habitat</span></h2>\n<p>It breeds within the forest zone of eastern Siberia from the Yenisey basin eastwards to Kamchatka, northern Koryak, eastern Magadan Oblast, northern Khabarovsk Krai, southeastern and northern Sakha east central Irkutsk Oblast, and northern Krasnoyarsk Krai. It is a migratory species, wintering in South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, northern and eastern China, from Beijing down the coast to the Vietnam border, and west to Yunnan then north to Chongqing and Henan.</p><p>It breeds in pools on the tundra edge and within swampy forests. In winter it is found on lowland fresh waters.\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Status\">Status</span></h2>\n<p>This species is classified as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List, though it was classified as Vulnerable before 2011 due to hunting and destruction of its wintering wetland habitats. These threats remain, but the Baikal teal is recovering, with increased numbers of wintering birds and some increase in habitat area. Based on the numbers of Baikal teal counted wintering in South Korea, the global population is estimated to be around 1.07\u00a0million individual adults around 2010, a major increase from the tens of thousands counted in the 1980s and few hundreds of thousands in the 2000s.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Gallery\">Gallery</span></h2>\n<ul class=\"gallery mw-gallery-traditional\"><li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 235px\">\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 235px\">\n</ul><h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n\n<h2><span id=\"External_links\">External links</span></h2>\n<ul><li>Images and movies of the Baikal teal <i>(Anas formosa)</i> on ARKive</li>\n<li>Baikal Teal from the Internet Bird Collection</li></ul> "

It is smaller but similar in colouration to the common myna but differs in having a brick red bare skin behind the eye in place of yellow. It is greyer on the underside and in this and in the presence of a slight tuft of feathers bears some resemblance to the jungle myna. They are found in flocks on the plains of northern and central India, often within towns and cities. Their range appears to be extending southwards in India. The name is derived from their habit of nesting almost exclusively in the earthen banks of rivers where they excavate holes and breed in large colonies.\n</p>\n\n\n<h2><span id=\"Description\">Description</span></h2>\n\n<p>The head is black on the crown and sides and the upper plumage is slaty grey while the underside is lighter grey with pale pink plumage towards the centre of the abdomen. The wing is black but has a wing patch at the base of the primaries and the tips of the outer tail feathers are pale pinkish buff. The naked skin behind the eye is brick red, the legs are yellow while the iris is deep red. The sexes are indistinguishable in the field. Young birds have a browner head and neck.</p><p>The species is evolutionarily closest to the common myna.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Habitat_and_distribution\">Habitat and distribution</span></h2>\n<p>The native range of the bank myna is almost restricted to the Indian subcontinent from the Indus valley in the West, to the Gangetic delta in the East and south of the lower foothills of the Himalayas, only rarely being found in sheltered valleys. They are found mainly in the vicinity of open water and their usual habitat is cultivated farmland and open country but flocks will often live within cities, in markets and railway stations. They make use of food scrap disposed by humans, even following catering vehicles at airports to standing aircraft.</p>\n\n<p>The distribution was formerly noted to be restricted north roughly of a line between Bombay and Balasore in Orissa, but the species may be expanding its range. They are also common in Pakistan in the districts of Sind and Punjab. A specimen from Kandahar was earlier considered the westernmost record a vagrant, but the birds have since established in the region. Although mainly resident, they make movements in response to food and weather. The species name of the bird is based on the name given by Latham from a description by Pierre Sonnerat who described <i>Le petit Martin de Gingi</i> in 1782, referring to Gingee near Pondicherry in southern India. Thomas C. Jerdon noted in 1863 that the species did not occur in southern India however the species was recorded in the region in 1914 at Vandalur near Madras. Records from further south in India are however increasing. Breeding colonies have been found in Assam.</p><p>These mynas have been introduced into Kuwait, where they have established in the wild. Flocks have also been found in the Maldives, Taiwan and Japan.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Behaviour_and_ecology\">Behaviour and ecology</span></h2>\n\n<p>Bank mynas are gregarious foraging in flocks, breeding colonially and roosting together in trees. They perch on livestock and live in crowded towns allowing close approach, often picking up scraps in markets and dumps. They are vociferous and use a wide range of calls that include clucks, croaks, screeches, whistles and warbling elements.</p><p>Bank mynas feed on grain, insects and fruits. Like the common myna, they sometimes follow grazing animals picking up disturbed insects or even ticks on the animals. They feed on ripening crops such as those of sorghum, grape and pearl millet. They feed on a variety of insects, including some that are crop pests such as <i>Achaea janata</i> whose caterpillars feed on castor.</p>\n\n<p>Bank mynas have a nesting season from April to July or August, most birds breeding in May and June. The nest is always built in earth walls, on the banks of rivers, embankments or the sides of open wells. They will sometimes make use of holes in brick walls. Nests have also been recorded between stacked bales of sugarcane stalks. They excavate the nest hole, the egg chamber sometimes 4 to 7 feet from the entrance. The nest is lined with grass, feathers and sometimes snake sloughs. About four of five pale sky blue or greenish-blue eggs is the usual clutch. Two broods may be raised in the same season. The eggs hatch after about 13 to 14 days. Nestlings open their eyes after about 5 days and fledge in about 21 days.

        "details": "<p class=\"mw-empty-elt\">\n</p>\n<p>The <b>bar-headed goose</b> (<i>Anser indicus</i>) is a goose that breeds in Central Asia in colonies of thousands near mountain lakes and winters in South Asia, as far south as peninsular India. It lays three to eight eggs at a time in a ground nest. It is known for the extreme altitudes it reaches when migrating across the Himalayas.\n</p>\n\n\n<h2><span id=\"Taxonomy\">Taxonomy</span></h2>\n<p>The grey goose genus <i>Anser</i> has no other member indigenous to the Indian region, nor any at all to the Ethiopian, Australian, or Neotropical regions. Ludwig Reichenbach placed the bar-headed goose in the monotypic genus <i>Eulabeia</i> in 1852, though John Boyd's taxonomy treats both <i>Eulabeia</i> and the genus <i>Chen</i> as subgenera of <i>Anser</i>.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Description\">Description</span></h2>\n<p>The bird is pale grey and is easily distinguished from any of the other grey geese of the genus <i>Anser</i> by the black bars on its head. It is also much paler than the other geese in this genus. In flight, its call is a typical goose honking. A mid-sized goose, it measures 71\u201376\u00a0cm (28\u201330\u00a0in) in total length and weighs 1.87\u20133.2\u00a0kg (4.1\u20137.1\u00a0lb).\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Ecology\">Ecology</span></h2>\n\n\n<p>The summer habitat is high-altitude lakes where the bird grazes on short grass. The species has been reported as migrating south from Tibet, Kazakhstan, Mongolia and Russia before crossing the Himalaya. The bird has come to the attention of medical science in recent years as having been an early victim of the H5N1 virus, HPAI (highly pathogenic avian influenza), at Qinghai. It suffers predation from crows, foxes, ravens, sea eagles, gulls and others. The total population may, however, be increasing, but it is complex to assess population trends, as this species occurs over more than 2,500,000\u00a0km<sup>2</sup> (970,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi).</p><p>\nThe bar-headed goose is one of the world's highest-flying birds, having been heard flying across Mount Makalu\u00a0\u2013 the fifth highest mountain on earth at 8,481\u00a0m (27,825\u00a0ft)\u00a0\u2013 and apparently seen over Mount Everest\u00a0\u2013 8,848\u00a0m (29,029\u00a0ft)\u00a0\u2013 although this is a second-hand report with no verification. This demanding migration has long puzzled physiologists and naturalists: \"there must be a good explanation for why the birds fly to the extreme altitudes... particularly since there are passes through the Himalaya at lower altitudes, and which are used by other migrating bird species.\" In fact, bar-headed geese had for a long time not been directly tracked (using GPS or satellite logging technology) flying higher than 6,540 metres (21,460\u00a0ft), and it is now believed that they do take the high passes through the mountains. The challenging northward migration from lowland India to breed in the summer on the Tibetan Plateau is undertaken in stages, with the flight across the Himalaya (from sea-level) being undertaken non-stop in as little as seven hours. Surprisingly, despite predictable tail winds that blow up the Himalayas (in the same direction of travel as the geese), bar-headed geese spurn these winds, waiting for them to die down overnight, when they then undertake the greatest rates of climbing flight ever recorded for a bird, and sustain these climbs rates for hours on end, according to research published in 2011.</p><p>The 2011 study found the geese peaking at an altitude of around 6,400\u00a0m (21,000\u00a0ft). In a 2012 study that tagged 91 geese and tracked their migration routes, it was determined that the geese spent 95% of their time below 5,784\u00a0m (18,976\u00a0ft), choosing to take a longer route through the Himalayas in order to utilize lower-altitude valleys and passes. Only 10 of the tagged geese were ever recorded above this altitude, and only one exceeded 6,500\u00a0m (21,300\u00a0ft), reaching 7,290\u00a0m (23,920\u00a0ft). All but one of these high-altitude flights were recorded at night, which along with the early morning, is the most common time of day for geese migration. The colder denser air during these times may be equivalent to an altitude hundreds of meters lower. It is suspected by the authors of these two studies that tales of the geese flying at 8,000\u00a0m (26,000\u00a0ft) are apocryphal. Bar headed geese have been observed flying at 23,000\u00a0ft.</p><p>The bar-headed goose migrates over the Himalayas to spend the winter in parts of South Asia (from Assam to as far south as Tamil Nadu. The modern winter habitat of the species is cultivated fields, where it feeds on barley, rice and wheat, and may damage crops. Birds from Kyrgyzstan have been seen to stopover in western Tibet and southern Tajikistan for 20 to 30 days before migrating farther south. Some birds may show high wintering site fidelity.</p>\n\n<p>They nest mainly on the Tibetan Plateau. Intraspecific brood parasitism is noticed with lower rank females attempting to lay their eggs in the nests of higher ranking females.</p><p>The bar-headed goose is often kept in captivity, as it is considered beautiful and breeds readily. Records in Great Britain are frequent, and almost certainly relate to escapes. However, the species has bred on several occasions in recent years, and around five pairs were recorded in 2002, the most recent available report of the Rare Birds Breeding Panel. It is possible that, owing to a combination of frequent migration, accidental escapes and deliberate introduction, the species is becoming gradually more established in Great Britain. The bird is sociable and causes no problems for other birds. The feral population is believed to be declining in Great Britain due to over-hunting.</p><p>The bar-headed goose has escaped or been deliberately released to Florida, USA, but there is no evidence that the population is breeding and may only persist due to continuing releases or escapes..[2]\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Physiology_and_morphology\">Physiology and morphology</span></h2>\n\n<p>The main physiological challenge of bar-headed geese is extracting oxygen from hypoxic air and transporting it to aerobic muscle fibres in order to sustain flight at high altitudes. Flight is very metabolically costly at high-altitudes because birds need to flap harder in thin air to generate lift. Studies have found that bar-headed geese breathe more deeply and efficiently under low-oxygen conditions, which serves to increase oxygen uptake from the environment. The haemoglobin of their blood has a higher affinity for oxygen than that of low-altitude geese, which has been attributed to a single amino acid point mutation. This mutation causes a conformational shift in the haemoglobin molecule from the low-oxygen to the high-oxygen affinity form. The left-ventricle of the heart, which is responsible for pumping oxygenated blood to the body via systemic circulation, has significantly more capillaries in bar-headed geese than in lowland birds, maintaining oxygenation of cardiac muscle cells and thereby cardiac output. Compared to lowland birds, mitochondria (the main site of oxygen consumption) in the flight muscle of bar-headed geese are significantly closer to the sarcolemma, decreasing the intracellular diffusion distance of oxygen from the capillaries to the mitochondria.\n</p><p>Bar-headed geese have a slightly larger wing area for their weight than other geese, which is believed to help them fly at high altitudes. While this decreases the power output required for flight in thin air, birds at high altitude still need to flap harder than lowland birds.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Cultural_depiction\">Cultural depiction</span></h2>\n<p>The bar-headed goose has been suggested as being the model for the Hamsa of Indian mythology. Another interpretation suggests that the bar-headed goose is likely to be the <i>Kadamb</i> in ancient and medieval Sanskrit literature, whereas <i>Hamsa</i> generally refers to the swan.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Gallery\">Gallery</span></h2>\n<ul class=\"gallery mw-gallery-traditional\"><li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\">\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\">\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\">\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\">\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\">\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\">\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\">\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\">\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\">\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\">\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\">\n</ul><h2><span id=\"See_also\">See also</span></h2>\n<ul><li>Tsomoriri Wetland Conservation Reserve</li></ul><h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n\n<h2><span id=\"External_links\">External links</span></h2>\n<ul><li>Hawkes et al.

This species lives in close association with humans, and its insect-eating habits mean that it is tolerated by humans; this acceptance was reinforced in the past by superstitions regarding the bird and its nest. There are frequent cultural references to the barn swallow in literary and religious works due to both its living in close proximity to humans and its annual migration. The barn swallow is the national bird of Austria and Estonia.\n</p>\n\n\n<h2><span id=\"Description\">Description</span></h2>\n\n<p>The adult male barn swallow of the nominate subspecies <i>H. r. rustica</i> is 17\u201319\u00a0cm (6.7\u20137.5\u00a0in) long including 2\u20137\u00a0cm (0.79\u20132.76\u00a0in) of elongated outer tail feathers. It has a wingspan of 32\u201334.5\u00a0cm (12.6\u201313.6\u00a0in) and weighs 16\u201322\u00a0g (0.56\u20130.78\u00a0oz). It has steel blue upperparts and a rufous forehead, chin and throat, which are separated from the off-white underparts by a broad dark blue breast band. The outer tail feathers are elongated, giving the distinctive deeply forked \"swallow tail\". There is a line of white spots across the outer end of the upper tail. The female is similar in appearance to the male, but the tail streamers are shorter, the blue of the upperparts and breast band is less glossy, and the underparts paler. The juvenile is browner and has a paler rufous face and whiter underparts. It also lacks the long tail streamers of the adult.</p><p>The song of the male barn swallow is a cheerful warble, often ending with <i>su-seer</i> with the second note higher than the first but falling in pitch. Calls include <i>witt</i> or <i>witt-witt</i> and a loud <i>splee-plink</i> when excited (or trying to chase intruders away from the nest). The alarm calls include a sharp <i>siflitt</i> for predators like cats and a <i>flitt-flitt</i> for birds of prey like the hobby. This species is fairly quiet on the wintering grounds.</p><p>The distinctive combination of a red face and blue breast band render the adult barn swallow easy to distinguish from the African <i>Hirundo</i> species and from the welcome swallow (<i>Hirundo neoxena</i>) with which its range overlaps in Australasia. In Africa the short tail streamers of the juvenile barn swallow invite confusion with juvenile red-chested swallow (<i>Hirundo lucida</i>), but the latter has a narrower breast band and more white in the tail.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Taxonomy\">Taxonomy</span></h2>\n<p>The barn swallow was described by Linnaeus in his <i>Systema Naturae</i> in 1758 as <i>Hirundo rustica</i>, characterised as <i>H. rectricibus, exceptis duabus intermediis, macula alba notat\u00ees</i>. <i>Hirundo</i> is the Latin word for \"swallow\"; <i>rusticus</i> means \"of the country\". This species is the only one of that genus to have a range extending into the Americas, with the majority of <i>Hirundo</i> species being native to Africa. This genus of blue-backed swallows is sometimes called the \"barn swallows\".</p><p>The <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i> dates the English common name \"barn swallow\" to 1851, though an earlier instance of the collocation in an English-language context is in Gilbert White's popular book <i>The Natural History of Selborne</i>, originally published in 1789:\n</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The swallow, though called the chimney-swallow, by no means builds altogether in chimnies  [<i>sic</i>], but often within barns and out-houses against the rafters\u00a0... In <i>Sweden</i> she builds in barns, and is called <i>ladusvala</i>, the barn-swallow.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This suggests that the English name may be a calque on the Swedish term.\n</p><p>There are few taxonomic problems within the genus, but the red-chested swallow\u2014a resident of West Africa, the Congo basin, and Ethiopia\u2014was formerly treated as a subspecies of barn swallow. The red-chested swallow is slightly smaller than its migratory relative, has a narrower blue breast-band, and (in the adult) has shorter tail streamers. In flight, it looks paler underneath than barn swallow.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Subspecies\">Subspecies</span></h3>\n\n<p>Six subspecies of barn swallow are generally recognised. In eastern Asia, a number of additional or alternative forms have been proposed, including <i>saturata</i> by Robert Ridgway in 1883, <i>kamtschatica</i> by Benedykt Dybowski in 1883, <i>ambigua</i> by Erwin Stresemann and <i>mandschurica</i> by Wilhelm Meise in 1934. Given the uncertainties over the validity of these forms, this article follows the treatment of Turner and Rose.</p>\n<ul><li><i>H. r. rustica</i>, the nominate European subspecies, breeds in Europe and Asia, as far north as the Arctic Circle, south to North Africa, the Middle East and Sikkim, and east to the Yenisei River. It migrates on a broad front to winter in Africa, Arabia, and the Indian subcontinent. The barn swallows wintering in southern Africa are from across Eurasia to at least 91\u00b0E, and have been recorded as covering up to 11,660\u00a0km (7,250\u00a0mi) on their annual migration. The nominate European subspecies was the first to have its genome sequenced and published.</li>\n<li><i>H. r. transitiva</i> was described by Ernst Hartert in 1910. It breeds in the Middle East from southern Turkey to Israel and is partially resident, though some birds winter in East Africa. It has orange red underparts and a broken breast band.</li>\n<li><i>H. r. savignii</i>, the resident Egyptian subspecies, was described by James Stephens in 1817 and named for French zoologist Marie Jules C\u00e9sar Savigny. It resembles <i>transitiva</i>, which also has orange-red underparts, but <i>savignii</i> has a complete broad breast band and deeper red hue to the underparts.</li>\n<li><i>H. r. gutturalis</i>, described by Giovanni Antonio Scopoli in 1786, has whitish underparts and a broken breast band. Breast chestnut and lower underparts more pink-buff. The populations that breed in the central and eastern Himalayas have been included in this subspecies, although the primary breeding range is Japan and Korea. The east Asian breeders winter across tropical Asia from India and Sri Lanka east to Indonesia and New Guinea. Increasing numbers are wintering in Australia. It hybridises with <i>H. r. tytleri</i> in the Amur River area. It is thought that the two eastern Asia forms were once geographically separate, but the nest sites provided by expanding human habitation allowed the ranges to overlap. <i>H. r. gutturalis</i> is a vagrant to Alaska and Washington, but is easily distinguished from the North American breeding subspecies, <i>H. r. erythrogaster</i>, by the latter's reddish underparts.</li>\n<li><i>H. r. tytleri</i>, first described by Thomas Jerdon in 1864, and named for British soldier, naturalist and photographer Robert Christopher Tytler, has deep orange-red underparts and an incomplete breast band. The tail is also longer. It breeds in central Siberia south to northern Mongolia and winters from eastern Bengal east to Thailand and Malaysia.</li></ul>\n<ul><li><i>H. r. erythrogaster</i>, the North American subspecies described by Pieter Boddaert in 1783, differs from the European subspecies in having redder underparts and a narrower, often incomplete, blue breast band. It breeds throughout North America, from Alaska to southern Mexico, and migrates to the Lesser Antilles, Costa Rica, Panama and South America to winter. A few may winter in the southernmost parts of the breeding range. This subspecies funnels through Central America on a narrow front and is therefore abundant on passage in the lowlands of both coasts.</li></ul><p>The short wings, red belly and incomplete breast band of <i>H. r. tytleri</i> are also found in <i>H. r. erythrogaster</i>, and DNA analyses show that barn swallows from North America colonised the Baikal region of Siberia, a dispersal direction opposite to that for most changes in distribution between North America and Eurasia.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Behaviour\">Behaviour</span></h2>\n<h3><span id=\"Habitat_and_range\">Habitat and range</span></h3>\n\n\n<p>The preferred habitat of the barn swallow is open country with low vegetation, such as pasture, meadows and farmland, preferably with nearby water. This swallow avoids heavily wooded or precipitous areas and densely built-up locations. The presence of accessible open structures such as barns, stables, or culverts to provide nesting sites, and exposed locations such as wires, roof ridges or bare branches for perching, are also important in the bird's selection of its breeding range.</p><p>It breeds in the Northern Hemisphere from sea level to typically 2,700\u00a0m (8,900\u00a0ft), but to 3,000\u00a0m (9,800\u00a0ft) in the Caucasus and North America, and it is absent only from deserts and the cold northernmost parts of the continents. Over much of its range, it avoids towns, and in Europe is replaced in urban areas by the house martin. However, in Honsh\u016b, Japan, the barn swallow is a more urban bird, with the red-rumped swallow (<i>Cecropis daurica</i>) replacing it as the rural species.</p><p>In winter, the barn swallow is cosmopolitan in its choice of habitat, avoiding only dense forests and deserts. It is most common in open, low vegetation habitats, such as savanna and ranch land, and in Venezuela, South Africa and Trinidad and Tobago it is described as being particularly attracted to burnt or harvested sugarcane fields and the waste from the cane. In the absence of suitable roost sites, they may sometimes roost on wires where they are more exposed to predators. Individual birds tend to return to the same wintering locality each year and congregate from a large area to roost in reed beds. These roosts can be extremely large; one in Nigeria had an estimated 1.5 million birds. These roosts are thought to be a protection from predators, and the arrival of roosting birds is synchronised in order to overwhelm predators like African hobbies. The barn swallow has been recorded as breeding in the more temperate parts of its winter range, such as the mountains of Thailand and in central Argentina.</p><p>Migration of barn swallows between Britain and South Africa was first established on 23 December 1912 when a bird that had been ringed by James Masefield at a nest in Staffordshire, was found in Natal. As would be expected for a long-distance migrant, this bird has occurred as a vagrant to such distant areas as Hawaii, Bermuda, Greenland, Tristan da Cunha the Falkland Islands, and even Antarctica.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Feeding\">Feeding</span></h3>\n\n<p>The barn swallow is similar in its habits to other aerial insectivores, including other swallow species and the unrelated swifts. It is not a particularly fast flier, with a speed estimated at about 11 metres per second (25\u00a0mph), up to 20 metres per second (45\u00a0mph) and a wing beat rate of approximately 5, up to 7\u20139 times each second.</p><p>The barn swallow typically feeds in open areas 7\u20138\u00a0m (23\u201326\u00a0ft) above shallow water or the ground often following animals, humans or farm machinery to catch disturbed insects, but it will occasionally pick prey items from the water surface, walls and plants. In the breeding areas, large flies make up around 70% of the diet, with aphids also a significant component. However, in Europe, the barn swallow consumes fewer aphids than the house or sand martins. On the wintering grounds, Hymenoptera, especially flying ants, are important food items. When egg-laying barn swallows hunt in pairs, but otherwise will form often large flocks.</p><p>The amount of food a clutch will get depends on the size of the clutch, with larger clutches getting more food on average. The timing of a clutch also determines the food given; later broods get food that is smaller in size compared to earlier broods. This is because larger insects are too far away from the nest to be profitable in terms of energy expenditure.</p><p>Isotope studies have shown that wintering populations may utilise different feeding habitats, with British breeders feeding mostly over grassland, whereas Swiss birds utilised woodland more. Another study showed that a single population breeding in Denmark actually wintered in two separate areas.</p><p>The barn swallow drinks by skimming low over lakes or rivers and scooping up water with its open mouth. This bird bathes in a similar fashion, dipping into the water for an instant while in flight.</p><p>Swallows gather in communal roosts after breeding, sometimes thousands strong. Reed beds are regularly favoured, with the birds swirling <i>en masse</i> before swooping low over the reeds. Reed beds are an important source of food prior to and whilst on migration; although the barn swallow is a diurnal migrant that can feed on the wing whilst it travels low over ground or water, the reed beds enable fat deposits to be established or replenished.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Breeding\">Breeding</span></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The male barn swallow returns to the breeding grounds before the females and selects a nest site, which is then advertised to females with a circling flight and song. Plumage may be used to advertise: in some populations, like in the subspecies <i>H. r. gutturalis</i>, darker ventral plumage in males is associated with higher breeding success. In other populations, the breeding success of the male is related to the length of the tail streamers, with longer streamers being more attractive to the female. Males with longer tail feathers are generally longer-lived and more disease resistant, females thus gaining an indirect fitness benefit from this form of selection, since longer tail feathers indicate a genetically stronger individual which will produce offspring with enhanced vitality. Males in northern Europe have longer tails than those further south; whereas in Spain the male's tail streamers are only 5% longer than the female's, in Finland the difference is 20%. In Denmark, the average male tail length increased by 9% between 1984 and 2004, but it is possible that climatic changes may lead in the future to shorter tails if summers become hot and dry.</p><p>Males with long streamers also have larger white tail spots, and since feather-eating bird lice prefer white feathers, large white tail spots without parasite damage again demonstrate breeding quality; there is a positive association between spot size and the number of offspring produced each season.</p><p>The breeding season of the barn swallow is variable; in the southern part of the range, the breeding season usually is from February or March to early to mid September, although some late second and third broods finish in October. In the northern part of the range, it usually starts late May to early June and ends the same time as the breeding season of the southernmost birds.</p><p>Both sexes defend the nest, but the male is particularly aggressive and territorial. Once established, pairs stay together to breed for life, but extra-pair copulation is common, making this species genetically polygamous, despite being socially monogamous. Males guard females actively to avoid being cuckolded. Males may use deceptive alarm calls to disrupt extrapair copulation attempts toward their mates.</p><p>As its name implies, the barn swallow typically nests inside accessible buildings such as barns and stables, or under bridges and wharves. Before man-made sites became common, it nested on cliff faces or in caves, but this is now rare. The neat cup-shaped nest is placed on a beam or against a suitable vertical projection. It is constructed by both sexes, although more often by the female, with mud pellets collected in their beaks and lined with grasses, feathers, algae or other soft materials. The nest building ability of the male is also sexually selected; females will lay more eggs and at an earlier date with males who are better at nest construction, with the opposite being true with males that are not. After building the nest, barn swallows may nest colonially where sufficient high-quality nest sites are available, and within a colony, each pair defends a territory around the nest which, for the European subspecies, is 4 to 8\u00a0m<sup>2</sup> (43 to 86\u00a0sq\u00a0ft) in size. Colony size tends to be larger in North America.</p><p>In North America at least, barn swallows frequently engage in a mutualist relationship with ospreys. Barn swallows will build their nest below an osprey nest, receiving protection from other birds of prey that are repelled by the exclusively fish-eating ospreys. The ospreys are alerted to the presence of these predators by the alarm calls of the swallows.</p><p>There are normally two broods, with the original nest being reused for the second brood and being repaired and reused in subsequent years. The female lays two to seven, but typically four or five, reddish-spotted white eggs. The clutch size is influenced by latitude, with clutch sizes of northern populations being higher on average than southern populations. The eggs are 20\u00a0mm \u00d7\u00a014\u00a0mm (0.79\u00a0in \u00d7\u00a00.55\u00a0in) in size, and weigh 1.9\u00a0g (0.067\u00a0oz), of which 5% is shell. In Europe, the female does almost all the incubation, but in North America the male may incubate up to 25% of the time. The incubation period is normally 14\u201319 days, with another 18\u201323 days before the altricial chicks fledge. The fledged young stay with, and are fed by, the parents for about a week after leaving the nest. Occasionally, first-year birds from the first brood will assist in feeding the second brood. Compared to those from early broods, juvenile barn swallows from late broods have been found to migrate at a younger age, fuel less efficiently during migration and have lower return rates the following year.</p><p>The barn swallow will mob intruders such as cats or accipiters that venture too close to their nest, often flying very close to the threat. Adult barn swallows have few predators, but some are taken by accipiters, falcons, and owls. Brood parasitism by cowbirds in North America or cuckoos in Eurasia is rare.</p><p>Hatching success is 90% and the fledging survival rate is 70\u201390%. Average mortality is 70\u201380% in the first year and 40\u201370% for the adult. Although the record age is more than 11 years, most survive less than four years. Barn swallow nestlings have prominent red gapes, a feature shown to induce feeding by parent birds. An experiment in manipulating brood size and immune system showed the vividness of the gape was positively correlated with T-cell\u2013mediated immunocompetence, and that larger brood size and injection with an antigen led to a less vivid gape.</p><p>The barn swallow has been recorded as hybridising with the cliff swallow (<i>Petrochelidon pyrrhonota</i>) and the cave swallow (<i>P. fulva</i>) in North America, and the house martin (<i>Delichon urbicum</i>) in Eurasia, the cross with the latter being one of the most common passerine hybrids.</p>\n<ul class=\"gallery mw-gallery-traditional\"><li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\">\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\">\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\">\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\">\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\">\n</ul><h2><span id=\"Parasites_and_predators\">Parasites and predators</span></h2>\n\n<p>Barn swallows (and other small passerines) often have characteristic feather holes on their wing and tail feathers. These holes were suggested as being caused by avian lice such as <i>Machaerilaemus malleus</i> and <i>Myrsidea rustica</i>, although other studies suggest that they are mainly caused by species of <i>Brueelia</i>. Several other species of lice have been described from barn swallow hosts, including <i>Brueelia domestica</i> and <i>Philopterus microsomaticus</i>. The avian lice prefer to feed on white tail spots, and they are generally found more numerously on short-tailed males, indicating the function of unbroken white tail spots as a measure of quality. In Texas, the swallow bug (<i>Oeciacus vicarius</i>), which is common on species such as the cliff swallow, is also known to infest barn swallows.</p><p>Predatory bats such as the greater false vampire bat are known to prey on barn swallows. Swallows at their communal roosts attract predators and several falcon species make use of these opportunities. Falcon species confirmed as predators include the peregrine falcon and the African hobby.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Status\">Status</span></h2>\n<p>The barn swallow has an enormous range, with an estimated global extent of 51,700,000\u00a0km<sup>2</sup> (20,000,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) and a population of 190 million individuals. The species is evaluated as least concern on the 2007 IUCN Red List, and has no special status under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), which regulates international trade in specimens of wild animals and plants.</p><p>This is a species that has greatly benefited historically from forest clearance, which has created the open habitats it prefers, and from human habitation, which have given it an abundance of safe man-made nest sites. There have been local declines due to the use of DDT in Israel in the 1950s, competition for nest sites with house sparrows in the US in the 19th century, and an ongoing gradual decline in numbers in parts of Europe and Asia due to agricultural intensification, reducing the availability of insect food. However, there has been an increase in the population in North America during the 20th century with the greater availability of nesting sites and subsequent range expansion, including the colonisation of northern Alberta.</p><p>A specific threat to wintering birds from the European populations is the transformation by the South African government of a light aircraft runway near Durban into an international airport for the 2010 FIFA World Cup. The roughly 250\u00a0m (270\u00a0yd) square Mount Moreland reed bed is a night roost for more than three million barn swallows, which represent 1% of the global population and 8% of the European breeding population. The reed bed lies on the flight path of aircraft using the proposed La Mercy airport, and there were fears that it would be cleared because the birds could threaten aircraft safety. However, following detailed evaluation, advanced radar technology will be installed to enable planes using the airport to be warned of bird movements and, if necessary, take appropriate measures to avoid the flocks.</p><p>Climate change may affect the barn swallow; drought causes weight loss and slow feather regrowth, and the expansion of the Sahara will make it a more formidable obstacle for migrating European birds. Hot dry summers will reduce the availability of insect food for chicks. Conversely, warmer springs may lengthen the breeding season and result in more chicks, and the opportunity to use nest sites outside buildings in the north of the range might also lead to more offspring.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Relationship_with_humans\">Relationship with humans</span></h2>\n\n<p>The barn swallow is an attractive bird that feeds on flying insects and has therefore been tolerated by humans when it shares their buildings for nesting. As one of the earlier migrants, this conspicuous species is also seen as an early sign of summer's approach.</p><p>In the Old World, the barn swallow appears to have used man-made structures and bridges since time immemorial. An early reference is in Virgil's <i>Georgics</i> (29 BC), \"<i>Ante garrula quam tignis nidum suspendat hirundo</i>\" (Before the twittering swallow hangs its nest from the rafters).</p><p>Many cattle farmers believed that swallows spread <i>Salmonella</i> infections, however a study in Sweden showed no evidence of the birds being reservoirs of the bacteria.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"In_literature\">In literature</span></h3>\n<p>Many literary references are based on the barn swallow's northward migration as a symbol of spring or summer. The proverb about the necessity for more than one piece of evidence goes back at least to Aristotle's <i>Nicomachean Ethics</i>: \"For as one swallow or one day does not make a spring, so one day or a short time does not make a fortunate or happy man.\"</p><p>The barn swallow symbolises the coming of spring and thus love in the <i>Pervigilium Veneris</i>, a late Latin poem. In his poem \"The Waste Land\", T. S. Eliot quoted the line <i>\"Quando fiam uti chelidon [ut tacere desinam]?\"</i> (\"When will I be like the swallow, so that I can stop being silent?\") This refers to the myth of Philomela in which she turns into a nightingale, and her sister Procne into a swallow. On the other hand, an image of the assembly of swallows for their southward migration concludes John Keats's ode \"To Autumn\".\n</p><p>The swallow is cited in several of William Shakespeare's plays for the swiftness of its flight, with \"True hope is swift, and flies with swallow's wings\" from Act 5 of <i>Richard III</i>, and \"I have horse will follow where the game Makes way, and run like swallows o'er the plain.\" from the second act of <i>Titus Andronicus</i>. Shakespeare references the annual migration of the species in <i>The Winter's Tale</i>, Act 4: \"Daffodils, That come before the swallow dares, and take The winds of March with beauty\".\n</p><p>A swallow is the main character in Oscar Wilde's story, The Happy Prince.\n</p>\n<h3><span id=\"In_culture\">In culture</span></h3>\n\n<p>Gilbert White studied the barn swallow in detail in his pioneering work <i>The Natural History of Selborne</i>, but even this careful observer was uncertain whether it migrated or hibernated in winter. Elsewhere, its long journeys have been well observed, and a swallow tattoo is popular amongst nautical men as a symbol of a safe return; the tradition was that a mariner had a tattoo of this fellow wanderer after sailing 5,000\u00a0nmi (9,300\u00a0km; 5,800\u00a0mi). A second swallow would be added after 10,000\u00a0nmi (19,000\u00a0km; 12,000\u00a0mi) at sea. In the past, the tolerance for this beneficial insectivore was reinforced by superstitions regarding damage to the barn swallow's nest. Such an act might lead to cows giving bloody milk, or no milk at all, or to hens ceasing to lay. This may be a factor in the longevity of swallows' nests. Survival, with suitable annual refurbishment, for 10\u201315 years is regular, and one nest was reported to have been occupied for 48 years.</p><p>It is depicted as the <i>Martlet</i>, <i>Merlette</i> or <i>Merlot</i> in heraldry, where it represents younger sons who have no lands. It is also represented as lacking feet as this was a common belief at the time. As a result of a campaign by ornithologists, the barn swallow has been the national bird of Estonia since 23 June 1960.</p>\n<h4><span id=\"Barn_Swallows_on_Postage_Stamps\">Barn Swallows on Postage Stamps</span></h4>\n<p>Barn Swallows are one of the most depicted birds on postage stamps around the world.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"See_also\">See also</span></h2>\n\n<ul><li>Swallow migration versus hibernation</li></ul>\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n\n<h2><span id=\"Further_reading\">Further reading</span></h2>\n<ul><li><cite id=\"CITEREFSmiddy2010\" class=\"citation journal\">Smiddy, P (2010). \"Post-fledging roosting at the nest in juvenile barn swallows (<i>Hirundo rustica</i>)\". <i>Ir.

        "details": "<p class=\"mw-empty-elt\">\n</p>\n<p>The <b>baya weaver</b> (<i>Ploceus philippinus</i>) is a weaverbird found across the Indian Subcontinent and Southeast Asia. <span lang=\"sa\" dir=\"ltr\">Flocks</span> of these birds are found in grasslands, cultivated areas, scrub and secondary growth and they are best known for their hanging retort shaped nests woven from leaves. These nest colonies are usually found on thorny trees or palm fronds and the nests are often built near water or hanging over water where predators cannot reach easily. They are widespread and common within their range but are prone to local, seasonal movements mainly in response to rain and food availability.\n</p><p>Among the population variations, five subspecies are recognized. The nominate race <i>philippinus</i> is found through much of mainland India while <i>burmanicus</i> is found eastwards into Southeast Asia. The population in southwest India is darker above and referred to as subspecies <i>travancoreensis</i>.</p>\n\n\n<h2><span id=\"Taxonomy\">Taxonomy</span></h2>\n<p>In 1760 the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson included a description of the baya weaver in his <i>Ornithologie</i> based on a specimen that he believed had been collected in Philippines. He used the French name <i>Le gros-bec des Philippines</i> and the Latin <i>Coccothraustes Philippensis</i>. Although Brisson coined Latin names, these do not conform to the binomial system and are not recognised by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature. When in 1766 the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his <i>Systema Naturae</i> for the twelfth edition, he added 240 species that had been previously described by Brisson. One of these was the baya weaver. Linnaeus included a brief description, coined the binomial name <i>Loxia philippina</i> and cited Brisson's work. It was subsequently realised that Brisson was mistaken in believing that his specimen came from the Philippines and the type locality was redesignated as Sri Lanka. This species is now placed in the genus <i>Ploceus</i> that was introduced by the French naturalist Georges Cuvier in 1816.</p><p>There are five subspecies:</p>\n<ul><li><i>P. p. philippinus</i> (Linnaeus, 1766) \u2013 Pakistan, India (except southwest and northeast), Sri Lanka and south Nepal</li>\n<li><i>P. p. travancoreensis</i> Ali &amp; Whistler, 1936 \u2013 southwest India</li>\n<li><i>P. p. burmanicus</i> Ticehurst, 1932 \u2013 Bhutan, northeast India and Bangladesh through Myanmar to southwest China</li>\n<li><i>P. p. angelorum</i> Deignan, 1956 \u2013 Thailand and south Laos</li>\n<li><i>P. p. infortunatus</i> Hartert, 1902 \u2013 south Vietnam, Malay Peninsula, Borneo and Sumatra, Java and Bali</li></ul><h2><span id=\"Description\">Description</span></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>These are sparrow-sized (15\u00a0cm) and in their non-breeding plumage, both males and females resemble female house sparrows. They have a stout conical bill and a short square tail. Non-breeding males and females look very similar: dark brown streaked fulvous buff above, plain (unstreaked) whitish fulvous below, eyebrow long and buff coloured, bill is horn coloured and no mask. Breeding males have a bright yellow crown, dark brown mask, blackish brown bill, upper parts are dark brown streaked with yellow, with a yellow breast and cream buff below.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Behaviour_and_ecology\">Behaviour and ecology</span></h2>\n<p>Baya weavers are social and gregarious birds. They forage in flocks for seeds, both on the plants and on the ground. Flocks fly in close formations, often performing complicated manoeuvres. They are known to glean paddy and other grain in harvested fields, and occasionally damage ripening crops and are therefore sometimes considered as pests. They roost in reed-beds bordering waterbodies. They depend on wild grasses such as Guinea grass (<i>Panicum maximum</i>) as well as crops like rice for both their food (feeding on seedlings in the germination stage as well as on early stages of grain) and nesting material. They also feed on insects (including butterflies), sometimes taking small frogs, geckos and molluscs, especially to feed their young. Their seasonal movements are governed by food availability. Their calls are a continuous <i>chit-chit-...</i> sometimes ending in a wheezy <i>cheee-eee-ee</i> that is produced by males in a chorus. A lower intensity call is produced in the non-breeding season.</p><p>They are occasionally known to descend to the ground and indulge in dust bathing.</p><p>In captivity, individuals are known to form stable <i>peck orders</i>.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Breeding\">Breeding</span></h3>\n<p>The breeding season of the baya weavers is during the monsoons. The breeding condition is initiated by environmental characters such as day length and comes to an end late in summer.  This post-reproductive \"photorefractoriness\", in which photoperiodic  birds cease to respond reproductively to the stimulation of long days, can end spontaneously without having been exposed to short days for 4-6 months unlike temperate birds. They nest in colonies typically of up to 20\u201330, close to the source of food, nesting material and water. Baya weavers are best known for the elaborately woven nests constructed by the males. These pendulous nests are retort-shaped, with a central nesting chamber and a long vertical tube that leads to a side entrance to the chamber. The nests are woven with long strips of paddy leaves, rough grasses and long strips torn from palm fronds. Each strip can be between 20 and 60\u00a0cm in length. A male bird is known to make up to 500 trips to complete a nest. The birds use their strong beaks to strip and collect the strands, and to weave and knot them while building their nests. The nests are often built hanging over water from palm trees and often suspended from thorny <i>Acacia</i>s and in some cases from telephone wires. Although the birds prefer thorny trees, they sometimes use avenue trees in urban areas. Nests are often located on the eastern side of the tree, where they are believed to provide shelter from the Southwest Monsoon; however, late breeders are more likely to build their nests in other orientations relative to the trunk of the nest tree. Abandoned nests are sometimes used by mice (<i>Mus booduga</i>) and other birds such as munias.</p>\n\n<p>Nests are built mainly in colonies but isolated nests are not unknown. Nests are often built from thorny <i>Acacia</i> or palm trees ( mainly <i>Phoenix sylvestris</i>) and hang over open water. Young males may build experimental nests among reeds. In Burma, birds often build nests under the eaves of buildings, but this habit is uncommon in India. The males take about 18 days to construct the complete nest with the intermediate \"helmet stage\" taking about 8 days. The nests are partially built before the males begin to display to passing females by flapping their wings and calling while hanging from their nests. The females inspect the nest and signal their acceptance of a male. Once a male and a female are paired, the male goes on to complete the nest by adding the entrance tunnel. Males are almost solely in charge of nest building, though their female partners may join in giving the finishing touches, particularly on the interiors. Females may modify the interiors or add blobs of mud. A study has found that nest location is more important than nest structure for the female when it selects the nest and mate. Females prefer nests high in trees, those over dry land, and those on thin branches.</p><p>Both males and females are polygamous. Males build many partial nests and begin courting females. The male finishes the nest only after finding a mate. The female lays about 2 to 4 white eggs and incubates them for about 14 to 17 days. Males may sometimes assist in feeding the chicks. The chicks leave the nest after about 17 days. After mating with a female the male typically court other females at other partially constructed nests. Intraspecific brood parasitism is known, that is, females may lay their eggs in the nests of others. Young birds leave the nest in a juvenal plumage which is replaced in their first moult after about four to six months. The young disperse to new locations not far from their nest and young have been located up to two kilometres away from their origin. Females are capable of breeding after a year while males take half a year longer. Prior to breeding they go through a prenuptial moult. Adults also go through a second moult after breeding and thus there are two moults each year. Histochemical studies have shown increased lipid metabolism in the crown region of male Baya during the breeding season. Lipids are known to be involved in the transport of the yellow carotenoid pigments that form the crown and are subsequently metabolized.</p><p>The nest, being suspended from thorny trees and overhanging water, is protected from many predators, but nest predation by crows is not unusual. Brood may also be destroyed by lizards such as <i>Calotes versicolor</i> or rodents such as <i>Vandeleuria oleracea</i> which may take over the nest. Nests may sometimes be taken over and used for nesting by munias and Indian silverbills (<i>Euodice malabarica</i>).</p>\n<ul class=\"gallery mw-gallery-packed\"><li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 162px\">\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 162px\">\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 105.33333333333px\">\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 162px\">\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 110px\">\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 183.33333333333px\">\n</ul><h2><span id=\"In_culture\">In culture</span></h2>\n<p>A widespread folk belief in India is that the baya sticks fireflies with mud to the nest walls to light up the interior of the nest at night. Clay, however is known to be used in the nests of baya weavers. Males alone have been seen to add blobs of mud and dung to the nest chamber prior to pairing with a female. It has been suggested that the clay may help to stabilise the nest in strong winds.</p><p>In earlier times, the baya weaver was trained by street performers in India for entertainment. They could pick up objects at the command of their trainers. They were trained to fire toy cannons, string beads, pick up coins and other objects. According to Edward Blyth \"the truth is, that the feats performed by trained Bayas are really very wonderful, and must be witnessed to be fully credited. Exhibitors carry them about, we believe, to all parts of the country; and the usual procedure is, when ladies are present, for the bird, on a sign from its master, to take a sweetmeat in its bill, and deposit it between a lady's lips, and repeat this offering to every lady present, the bird following the look and gesture of its master. A miniature cannon is then brought, which the bird loads with coarse grains of powder....\" Robert Tytler noted demonstrations where the bird would twirl a thin stick with fires at the ends over its head. These uses have been noted from the time of Akbar.\n</p>\n<blockquote class=\"templatequote\"><p>The baya is like a wild sparrow but yellow. It is extremely intelligent, obedient and docile.

Some ornithologists (including AOU 2007) split them into two species based on breeding habitat, whether in forest bogs in the subarctic taiga, or on the arctic tundra.

Traditionally considered an Old World vulture, it actually forms a minor lineage of Accipitridae together with the Egyptian vulture (<i>Neophron percnopterus</i>), its closest living relative. It is not much more closely related to the Old World vultures proper than to, for example, hawks, and differs from the former by its feathered neck. Although dissimilar, the Egyptian and bearded vulture each have a lozenge-shaped tail\u2014unusual among birds of prey.\n</p><p>The bearded vulture is the only known vertebrate whose diet consists almost exclusively (70 to 90 percent) of bone.  It lives and breeds on crags in high mountains in southern Europe, the Caucasus, Africa, the Indian subcontinent, and Tibet, laying one or two eggs in mid-winter that hatch at the beginning of spring. Populations are residents.\n</p><p>The population of this species continues to decline. Until July 2014, it was classified by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species as being of Least Concern; it has, however, since been reassessed as Near Threatened.\n</p>\n\n\n<h2><span id=\"Distribution_and_habitat\">Distribution and habitat</span></h2>\n<p>The lammergeier is sparsely distributed across a vast, considerable range. It can be found in mountainous regions from Europe east to Siberia (Palearctic) and Africa. It is found in the Pyrenees, the Alps, the Caucasus region, the Zagros Mountains, the Alborz, the Koh-i-Baba in Bamyan, Afghanistan, the Altai Mountains, the Himalayas, Ladakh in northern India, western and central China, Israel (Where although extinct as a breeder since 1981, single young birds have been reported in 2000, 2004 and 2016 ), and the Arabian Peninsula. In Africa, it is found in the Atlas Mountains, the Ethiopian Highlands and down from Sudan to northeastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, central Kenya and northern Tanzania. An isolated population inhabits the Drakensberg of South Africa.</p><p>This species is almost entirely associated with mountains and inselbergs with plentiful cliffs, crags, precipices, canyons and gorges. They are often found near alpine pastures and meadows, montane grassland and heath, steep-sided, rocky wadis, high steppe and are occasional around forests. They seem to prefer desolate, lightly-populated areas where predators who provide many bones, such as wolves and golden eagles, have healthy populations.\n</p><p>In Ethiopia, they are now common at refuse tips on the outskirts of small villages and towns. Although they occasionally descend to 300\u2013600\u00a0m (980\u20131,970\u00a0ft), bearded vultures are rare below an elevation of 1,000\u00a0m (3,300\u00a0ft) and normally reside above 2,000\u00a0m (6,600\u00a0ft) in some parts of their range. They are typically found around or above the tree line which are often near the tops of the mountains, at up to 2,000\u00a0m (6,600\u00a0ft) in Europe, 4,500\u00a0m (14,800\u00a0ft) in Africa and 5,000\u00a0m (16,000\u00a0ft) in central Asia. In southern Armenia they have been found to breed below 1,000\u00a0m (3,300\u00a0ft) if cliff availability permits. They even have been observed living at altitudes of 7,500\u00a0m (24,600\u00a0ft) on Mount Everest and been observed flying at a height of 24,000\u00a0ft (7,300\u00a0m).</p><p>During 1970s and 1980s the population of the bearded vulture in southern Africa declined however their distribution remained constant. The bearded vulture population occupies the highlands of Lesotho, Free State, Eastern Cape and Maloti-Drakensberg mountains in KwaZulu-Natal. Adult bearded vultures utilise areas with higher altitudes, with steep slopes and sharp points and within areas that are situated closer to their nesting sites . Adult bearded vultures are more likely to fly below 200m over Lesotho. Along the Drakensberg Escarpment from the area of Golden Gate Highlands National Park south into the northern part of the Eastern Cape there was the greatest densities of bearded vultures.\n</p><p>Abundance of bearded vultures is shown for eight regions within the species' range in southern Africa. The total population of bearded vultures in southern Africa is calculated as being 408 adult birds and 224 young birds of all age classes therefore giving an estimate of about 632 birds.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Description\">Description</span></h2>\n\n<p>This bird is 94\u2013125\u00a0cm (37\u201349\u00a0in) long with a wingspan of 2.31\u20132.83\u00a0m (7.6\u20139.3\u00a0ft). It weighs 4.5\u20137.8\u00a0kg (9.9\u201317.2\u00a0lb), with the nominate race averaging 6.21\u00a0kg (13.7\u00a0lb) and <i>G. b. meridionalis</i> of Africa averaging 5.7\u00a0kg (13\u00a0lb). In Eurasia, vultures found around the Himalayas tend to be slightly larger than those from other mountain ranges. Females are slightly larger than males. It is essentially unmistakable with other vultures or indeed other birds in flight due to its long, narrow wings, with the wing chord measuring 71.5\u201391\u00a0cm (28.1\u201335.8\u00a0in), and long, wedge-shaped tail, which measures 42.7\u201352\u00a0cm (16.8\u201320.5\u00a0in) in length. The tail is longer than the width of the wing. The tarsus is relatively small for the bird's size, at 8.8\u201310\u00a0cm (3.5\u20133.9\u00a0in). The proportions of the species have been compared to a falcon, scaled to an enormous size.</p><p>Unlike most vultures, the bearded vulture does not have a bald head. This species is relatively small headed, although its neck is powerful and thick. It has a generally elongated, slender shape, sometimes appearing bulkier due to the often hunched back of these birds. The gait on the ground is waddling and the feet are large and powerful. The adult is mostly dark gray, rusty and whitish in color. It is grey-blue to grey-black above. The creamy-coloured forehead contrasts against a black band across the eyes and lores and bristles under the chin, which form a black beard that give the species its English name. Bearded vultures are variably orange or rust of plumage on their head, breast and leg feathers but this is actually cosmetic.

        "details": " <p class=\"mw-empty-elt\">\n\n</p>\n<p>The <b>Bengal florican</b> (<i>Houbaropsis bengalensis</i>), also called <b>Bengal bustard</b>, is a bustard species native to the Indian subcontinent, Cambodia, and Vietnam. It is listed as Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List because fewer than 1,000 individuals were estimated to be alive as of 2017. It is the only member of the genus <i>Houbaropsis</i>.\n</p>\n\n\n<h2><span id=\"Description\">Description</span></h2>\n\n\n<p>Adult Bengal floricans range from 66\u201368\u00a0cm (26\u201327\u00a0in) in length and stand around 55\u00a0cm (22\u00a0in) tall. The male has black plumage from the head and neck to underparts. Its head carries a long lanky crest, and the neck has elongated display plumes. The upperside is buff with fine black vermiculations and black arrowhead markings, and there is a conspicuous large white patch from the wing coverts to the remiges. In flight, the male's wings appear entirely white except for the dark primary remiges. The feet and legs are yellow, the bill and irides are dark.</p><p>Females are larger than the males and have a buff-brown colour similar to the males' back, with a dark brown crown and narrow dark streaks down the side of the neck. Their wing coverts are lighter than the remiges and covered in fine dark barring. Immature birds look like females. Adult females weigh around 1.7\u20131.9\u00a0kg (3.7\u20134.2\u00a0lb) against a weight of 1.2\u20131.5\u00a0kg (2.6\u20133.3\u00a0lb) in males.</p><p>They are normally silent but when disturbed utters a metallic <i>chik-chik-chik</i> call. Displaying males croak and produce a strange deep humming.</p><p>The only bird even remotely similar to adult males of the Bengal florican is the lesser florican (<i>Sypheotides indica</i>). This is a smaller, slimmer-necked bustard overall, and its males have cheek-tufts of plumes with pennant-like tips rather than the crest, and a white band between neck and back. The females are similar, and young Bengal floricans can be easily mistaken for female lesser floricans. The latter has almost white wing coverts however, resembling the males' wing patch.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Distribution_and_habitat\">Distribution and habitat</span></h2>\n\n<p>It has two disjunct populations, one in the Indian subcontinent, another in Southeast Asia. The former occurs from Uttar Pradesh (India) through the Terai of Nepal to Assam (where it is called ulu mora) and Arunachal Pradesh in India, and historically to Bangladesh. The South East Asian population occurs in Cambodia and perhaps adjacent southern Vietnam. This species is mostly resident on its breeding grounds; around Tonl\u00e9 Sap in Cambodia however, the birds use grasslands near the lake to breed, and move away from the water in the wet season when the breeding grounds are flooded. Similarly, the Terai population seems to move to warmer lowland locations in winter. Migrations are not long-distance, however, and probably are restricted to a few dozen kilometers.</p><p>Bengal floricans live in open tall grassland habitats with scattered bushes. The most important grass species are satintails (<i>Imperata</i>, in particular Cogongrass <i>I. cylindrica</i>), sugarcane (<i>Saccharum</i>, in particular <i>S. munja</i> and Kans Grass <i>S. spontaneum</i>), as well as <i>Desmostachya bipinnata</i>. The birds are usually encountered in the early mornings and evenings and are most easily spotted in the breeding season from March to August, which is when most censuses of the population are conducted. Particular between March and May, when they give their stunning courtship display, males are far more conspicuous than the cryptically-coloured females, which moreover prefer high grassland rich in sugarcane.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Status_and_conservation\">Status and conservation</span></h3>\n\n<p>Restricted to tiny fragments of grassland scattered across South and Southeast Asia, the Bengal florican is the world's rarest bustard. It is known to have become increasingly threatened by land conversion for intensive agriculture, particularly for dry season rice production. Poaching continues to be a problem in Southeast Asia, while the South Asian population is down to less than 350 adult birds, about 85% of which are found in India. Though more threatened, birds in Southeast Asia may number as many as in South Asia but more probably closer to or even less than 1,000 adults.</p><p>The population has decreased dramatically in past decades. It may be that in India the decline is coming to a halt and that stocks in Dibru-Saikhowa and Kaziranga National Parks and Dudhwa Tiger Reserve are safe at very low levels. Still, its global status is precarious and it was consequently uplisted from Endangered to Critically Endangered in the 2007 IUCN Red List.</p><p>In Cambodia, it is mostly found in Kampong Thom Province; lesser numbers are found in Siem Reap Province and remnants might persist in Banteay Meanchey, Battambang and Pursat Provinces. Its rate of decline there has accelerated in the early 21st century, and the bird's numbers in Southeast Asia might fall to effective extinction in the early 2010s. The government of Cambodia has taken a significant step towards protecting important habitat for the Bengal florican. Along with 350 square kilometres being designated as \"Integrated Farming and Biodiversity Areas\", where land-use practices are adapted to also benefit the Bengal florican, a public education program to inform schoolchildren about the bird has also been undertaken. At present, the species may persist in the Ang Trapaing Thmor Crane Sanctuary and perhaps Vietnam's Tr\u00e0m Chim National Park, but the South Asian population is not known with certainty from any protected areas.</p><p>In Nepal, it is essentially restricted to protected areas, namely Sukla Phanta Wildlife Reserve, Bardia and Chitwan National Parks. Since 1982, the Sukla Phanta and Bardia populations appear to have been stable, but the Chitwan population has declined. In 2001, 20\u201328 birds were estimated in Sukla Phanta, 6\u201310 birds in Bardia, and 6\u201322 birds in Chitwan. It used to be fairly common in the Koshi Tappu Wildlife Reserve but has not been recorded there since 1990, and has not been sighted around the Koshi Barrage since the 1980s. In spring 2007, 8\u20139 males were recorded in Sukla Phanta and 16\u201318 birds estimated; one male was sighted in Bardia and 2\u20134 estimated; five males were sighted in Chitwan and 10\u201314 estimated. The population in Nepal has declined by 56% since 1982 and by 30% since 2001. In spring 2011, 17 birds were recorded from nine different sites along a 39\u00a0km (24\u00a0mi) north-south stretch of the Koshi River. Seven were males and 10 were females. Only five individuals were recorded outside the reserve, two pairs north of Koshi Tappu, and one female seen twice near the Koshi Barrage area.</p><p>The courtship display of males has been discussed by many naturalists travelling British India, and in the modern era attracts tourists who provide revenue to locals. Studies indicate that the Bengal florican is not a particularly shy or hemerophobic species, its apparent intolerance of human settlements being chiefly due to its intolerance of land clearance for agriculture. Pastures and the traditional use of common land for villagers' tall-grass harvest (for construction and handicraft) actually seem to be tolerated quite well by the birds.</p><p>If firewood and timber is collected from grassland rather than from forests, human land use will even benefit the species. In particular, sal (<i>Shorea robusta</i>) and saj (<i>Terminalia elliptica</i>) have been identified as trees that encroach upon the florican's habitat in Nepal, and its decline in Bardia National Park is probably chiefly due to insufficient use of trees that overgrow grassland. A sustainable land-management technique that will bolster Bengal florican stocks consists of harvesting grass and particularly wood from changing tracts of land, leaving some areas unharvested each year and setting aside a few additional ones as reserve land, where grasses can grow tall for years until they are harvested. Controlled burning may be necessary when woodland encroachment is strong; it should take place before March so that the year's offspring are not harmed.\nA landscape ecology approach, integrating social, biological and physical environmental elements at scales compatible with management objectives, will be needed to effectively conserve Bengal floricans and their grassland habitats.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n\n<h2><span id=\"Further_reading\">Further reading</span></h2>\n<ul><li>Grimmett, R; Inskipp, C. and T.

It is a common resident breeder in much of tropical southern Asia from southwest Iran through India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka east to southern China and Indonesia and accidental visitor of Japan. It is an all black bird with a distinctive forked tail and measures 28\u00a0cm (11\u00a0in) in length. It feeds on insects, and is common in open agricultural areas and light forest throughout its range, perching conspicuously on a bare perch or along power or telephone lines. The species is known for its aggressive behaviour towards much larger birds, such as crows, never hesitating to dive-bomb any bird of prey that invades its territory. This behaviour earns it the informal name of king crow. Smaller birds often nest in the well-guarded vicinity of a nesting black drongo. Previously grouped along with the African fork-tailed drongo (<i>Dicrurus adsimilis</i>), the Asian forms are now treated as a separate species with several distinct populations.\n</p><p>The black drongo has been introduced to some Pacific islands, where it has thrived and become abundant to the point of threatening and causing the extinction of native and endemic bird species there.\n</p>\n\n\n<h2><span id=\"Taxonomy_and_systematics\">Taxonomy and systematics</span></h2>\n\n<p>The black drongo was once considered a subspecies of the fork-tailed drongo (<i>Dicrurus adsimilis</i>), a close relative that diverged relatively recently. The two are now considered distinct species, with the fork-tailed drongo restricted to Africa and separated from the Asian range of the black drongo.</p><p>Seven subspecies have been named but the largely contiguous populations show clinal variation and intergrade with each other. Individuals from northern India (ssp. <i>albirictus</i>) are larger than those from the Sri Lankan population <i>minor</i> while those from the peninsular India (nominate subspecies) are intermediate in size. Race <i>cathoecus</i> is found in Thailand, Hong Kong and China. This race has a much smaller rictal spot and the wings are dark with a greenish gloss. In southern Siam a race <i>thai</i> is resident, but overlaps with wintering <i>cathoecus</i>. Race <i>javanus</i> is found on the islands of Java and Bali. Race <i>harterti</i> found in Formosa has the tail length less than the wing.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Description\">Description</span></h2>\n\n<p>This bird is glossy black with a wide fork to the tail. Adults usually have a small white spot at the base of the gape. The iris is dark brown (not crimson as in the similar ashy drongo). The sexes cannot be told apart in the field. Juveniles are brownish and may have some white barring or speckling towards the belly and vent, and can be mistaken for the white-bellied drongo. First-year birds have white tips to the feathers of the belly, while second-years have these white-tipped feathers restricted to the vent.</p><p>They are aggressive and fearless birds, and although only 28\u00a0cm (11\u00a0in) in length, they will attack much larger species that enter their nesting territory, including crows and birds of prey. This behaviour led to their former name of king crow. They fly with strong flaps of the wing and are capable of fast manoeuvres that enable them to capture flying insects. With short legs, they sit upright on thorny bushes, bare perches or electricity wires. They may also perch on grazing animals.</p><p>They are capable of producing a wide range of calls but a common call is a two note <i>tee-hee</i> call resembling that of the shikra (<i>Accipiter badius</i>).</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Distribution_and_habitat\">Distribution and habitat</span></h2>\n\n<p>The black drongo is found predominantly in open country and usually perches and hunts close to the ground. They are mostly aerial predators of insects but also glean from the ground or off vegetation. They are found as summer visitors to northeastern Afghanistan and northern Pakistan but are residents from the Indus Valley until Bangladesh and into India and Sri Lanka. Some populations show seasonal movements that are poorly understood while populations in Korea are known to be migratory. The black drongo can be found in savanna, fields, and urban habitats.\n</p><p>Black drongos were introduced just before the Second World War from Taiwan to the island of Rota to help in the control of insects. It is believed that they dispersed over the sea to the island of Guam in the 1950s. By 1967, they were the fourth most commonly seen birds in roadside counts on Guam and are today the most abundant bird there. Predation by and competition from black drongos have been suggested as factors in the decline of endemic bird species such as the Rota bridled white-eye and the Guam flycatcher.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Behaviour_and_ecology\">Behaviour and ecology</span></h2>\n<h3><span id=\"Food_and_foraging\">Food and foraging</span></h3>\n\n<p>Black drongos become active very early at dawn and roost later than many other birds. They feed mainly on insects such as grasshoppers, cicadas, termites, wasps, bees, ants, moths, beetles and dragonflies. They sometimes fly close to tree branches, attempting to disturb any insects that may be present. They congregate in fields being ploughed, picking up exposed caterpillars and beetle grubs. As many as 35 birds have been seen at such congregations. They are also attracted to fires in scrub and grasslands habitats where insects are disturbed. They appear to avoid flies. They associate with common mynas, cattle egrets and other birds that share a similar diet and habitat. Drongos benefit from this association and are more successful in their foraging. There is only partial overlap in the insect prey sought by mynas and drongos although in rare instances the drongos may rob prey from mynas. It is said that they imitate the call of the shikra so as to put mynas to flight and then to steal prey. Similar behaviour, using false alarm calls, has been noted in the fork-tailed drongo. There are some cases of the black drongo preying on small birds, reptiles, or maybe even bats. It has been suggested that they may feed on birds more intensively on migration. An individual on a migratory stop-over island in Korea caught several birds one after the other, killing them by striking at the back of the head and neck and feeding selectively on parts, especially the brain. They have also been on occasion seen feeding on fish Flowers of trees such as <i>Erythrina</i> and <i>Bombax</i> may be visited for water and nectar and they are sometimes known to feed on grains. They are only rarely known to take larger arthropods such as scorpions and centipedes. They feed on milkweed butterflies that are often avoided by other predators and are known to feed late in the evening or night, often on insects attracted to artificial lights.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Nesting_and_breeding\">Nesting and breeding</span></h3>\n\n<p>Black drongos breed mainly in February and March in southern India, and until August in other parts of the country. Males and females sing in the mornings during the breeding season. Courtship can include aerobatic chases and they may lock their wings and beaks together, with the pair sometimes falling to the ground. Displays may be made on the ground. Pair bonds are retained for a whole breeding season. The nest is a cup made with a thin layer of sticks placed in the fork of branch, and is built in a week by both the male and female. Eggs are laid close to the first rains in April. The usual clutch is three or rarely four eggs laid in a cup nest placed in the fork of an outer branch of tree. Large leafy trees such as the jackfruit are preferred. The eggs are pale cream to red with spots and markings and are 26\u00a0mm (1.0\u00a0in) long and 19\u00a0mm (0.75\u00a0in) wide. The eggs are incubated by both parents and hatch after 14 to 15 days. Nestlings are brooded for the first five days, after which the young are capable of maintaining a fairly constant body temperature. A second clutch may be laid if the first is destroyed. Nests are sometimes built in telephone poles. A nesting territory of 0.003 to 0.012\u00a0km<sup>2</sup> (0.3 to 1.2\u00a0hectares) is maintained.</p><p>Helpers, offspring from the previous brood, have sometimes been noted to assist in feeding the fledglings at the nest of their parents. Cases of brood parasitism by the Asian koel have been noted. An average breeding success of 44% has been noted with the main cause of fledgling mortality being shortage of insect food which in turn was dependent on rainfall.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Mobbing_and_proximity_nesting\">Mobbing and proximity nesting</span></h3>\n\n<p>Their habit of driving away predators from near their nests is believed to encourage other birds such as orioles, doves, pigeons, babblers, and especially bulbuls, to nest in the vicinity. In one study 18 of 40 nests had red-vented bulbuls nesting within 10 metres (33\u00a0ft). An abnormal case of interspecific feeding with a red-vented bulbul feeding the chicks of a black drongo at their nest has been recorded.</p>\n<p>They are so aggressive that they may sometimes land on large birds of prey and peck them when mobbing. It has been suggested that the Asian drongo-cuckoo (<i>Surniculus lugubris</i>) has evolved to mimic this species. The intensity of mobbing predators was studied in Java and observations showed that there was a significant increase in mobbing, during the nesting season, of some predators such as the Javan hawk-eagle but the black eagle, a nest predator is mobbed with equal intensity in all seasons. It has been suggested that this strategy may avoid giving away the location of nests during the breeding season.</p><h3><span id=\"Growth_and_development\">Growth and development</span></h3>\n<p>Young birds have a yellowish-red gape. The feather follicles appear on the fourth day and pin feathers emerge after a week. Nestlings increase in weight steadily until they are 12 days old. The eyes open on the eighth day, the iris reddish-black while the gape turns red. The young leave the nest after about 16 to 20 days after hatching. They do not have the fork in the tail until three weeks. The parents continue to feed and protect them for a month. Young birds may beg for food for longer, but are often ignored or chased away by the adults. Birds reach breeding condition in about two years.</p><p>Play behaviour has been observed with birds dropping a leaf in the air and catching it in mid-air and these may possibly help young birds acquire aerobatic skills.</p><p>In southern India, they moult their feathers from June to October. The wing moult begins in July with the first primary and proceeds towards the tenth. Secondaries are replaced from August after the primaries are at the third quill. The secondary moult is not orderly, the 8th and 7th being dropped earlier than the rest. The tail feathers are moulted centrifugally. Seasonal colour changes in the testicular tissues are caused by variation in melanin synthesis, with the dark pigmentation being lost during the breeding season.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Parasites_and_diseases\">Parasites and diseases</span></h3>\n<p>Many ectoparasitic bird lice (<i>Myrsidea</i> spp. and <i>Menacanthus</i> spp.), endoparasitic cestodes and nematodes have been described from this species. However no predators or diseases are significant factors in adult mortality.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Relation_to_humans\">Relation to humans</span></h2>\n<p>Their habit of preying on bees makes them a nuisance to bee-keepers, but farmers attract them to their fields using artificial perches in fields to encourage them to feed on pest insects.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"In_culture\">In culture</span></h3>\n<p>Being common, they have a wide range of local names. The older genus name of <i>Buchanga</i> was derived from the Hindi name of <i>Bhujanga</i>. Other local names include \"srigunting hitam\" in Indonesia, <i>Thampal</i> in Pakistan, <i>Gohalo</i>/<i>Kolaho</i> in Baluchistan, <i>Kalkalachi</i> in Sindhi, <i>Kotwal</i> (=policeman) in Hindi; <i>Finga</i> in Bengali; <i>Phenshu</i> in Assamese; <i>Cheiroi</i> in Manipuri; <i>Kosita</i>/ <i>Kalo koshi</i> in Gujarati; <i>Ghosia</i> in Marathi; <i>Kajalapati</i> in Oriya; <i>Kari kuruvi</i> (=charcoal bird), <i>Erettai valan</i> (=two tail) in Tamil; <i>Passala poli gadu</i> in Telugu; <i>Aanaranji</i> (=elephant snatcher) in Malayalam; <i>Kari bhujanga</i> in Kannada and <i>Kalu Kawuda</i> in Sinhalese. A superstition in central India is that cattle would lose their horn if a newly fledged bird alighted on it. It is held in reverence in parts of Punjab in the belief that it brought water to Husayn ibn Ali, revered by Sh\u012b\u2018a Muslims.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n\n<h2><span id=\"Other_sources\">Other sources</span></h2>\n<ul><li><cite id=\"CITEREFBhujle_BV,_Nadkarni_VB1980\" class=\"citation journal\">Bhujle BV, Nadkarni VB (1980). \"Histological and histochemical observations on the adrenal gland of four species of birds, <i>Dicrurus macrocercus</i> (Viellot), <i>Centropus sinensis</i> (Stephens), <i>Sturnus pagodarum</i> (Gmelin) and <i>Columba livia</i> (Gmelin)\". <i>Zool.

Despite its large appearance (it is one of the largest eagles in its range), known weights are relatively modest, at between 1,000 and 1,600\u00a0g (2.2 and 3.5\u00a0lb), about half the weight of the partially sympatric mountain hawk-eagle, the latter being of a similar total length. Adults have all-black plumage, with a yellow bill base (cere) and feet. The wings are long and pinched in at the innermost primaries giving a distinctive shape. The tail shows faint barring and upper tail covers are paler. When perched the wing tips reach till or exceed the tail tip. The wings are held in a shallow V (wings just above the horizontal plane) in flight. Seen on hot afternoons, scouring the treetops for a nest to maraud, this bird is easily spotted by its jet black colour, large size, and a characteristic slow flight, sometimes just above the canopy.</p><p>Sexes are similar, but young birds have a buff head, underparts and underwing coverts. The wing shape helps to distinguish this species from the dark form of changeable hawk-eagle, (<i>Nisaetus cirrhatus</i>).

Race <i>perniger</i> (Hodgson, 1836) is found in the Himalayan foothills west through Nepal into the Indian states of Himachal Pradesh and Jammu &amp; Kashmir, and in the forests of the Eastern and Western Ghats in peninsular India and Sri Lanka. The bird's westernmost extent is from Gujarat, especially in the forested areas in southern and eastern Gujarat. The species also extends into the Aravalli range of northwestern India. The nominate race <i>malaiensis</i> (Temminck, 1822) is found in Burma, southern China (Yunnan, Fujian) and Taiwan, into Southeast Asia. They are generally residents and no migrations have been observed. In a study in southern India, it was found to favour forests with good forest cover and was absent from areas where the cover was less than 50%.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Behaviour_and_ecology\">Behaviour and ecology</span></h2>\n\n<h3><span id=\"Breeding\">Breeding</span></h3>\n<p>The courtship display involves steep dives with folded wings with swoops up in a U shape into a vertical stall. They build a platform nest, 3 to 4 feet wide, on a tall tree overlooking a steep valley. One or two white eggs which are blotched in brown and mauve may be laid during the nesting season between January and April. The nest site may be reused year after year.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Food_and_feeding\">Food and feeding</span></h3>\n<p>The black eagle eats mammals (including bats, squirrels and other small mammals), birds and eggs. It is a prolific nest-predator and is known for its slow flight just over the canopy. The curved claws and wide gape allow it to pick up eggs of birds from nests as well as swiftlets from caves. Along with swallow-tailed kites they share the unique habit of carrying away an entire nest with nestlings to a feeding perch. Squirrels, macaques and many species of birds emit alarm calls when these birds are spotted soaring over the forest.

It may be heard all day long in April, during nesting, and less persistently in March and May as well as the summer months. Both parents tend chicks after hatching. Young stay with parents through their first winter. The most likely breeding locations Savanna, Grasslands, Scrub vegetation areas under the cultivated crops. They have a loud call during the breeding season. Males may also become aggressive during the breeding season, make sure there is plenty of cover and escape routes for the hen and it maybe necessary to house her separate and allow limited access for breeding only. They are generally monogamous in the wild and it is best to house only pair per aviary. Well planted aviaries with little surrounding traffic would be best for breeding. They are fairly winter hardy, but always provide some shelter during the coldest months breeds from late March to September depending on the \nrange.\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Avicultural_data\">Avicultural data</span></h2>\n\n<p>The normal Clutch size between 10 and 14 eggs and only the hen incubates the eggs, the incubation period is 18 to 19 days and the breeding season is April to June and the young ones will appear in April through October.\n</p><p>Forages (plant, leaves, and stem) on the ground and eats a wide variety of seeds and insects.

It is thought to be the world's most abundant species of Accipitridae, although some populations have experienced dramatic declines or fluctuations. Current global population estimates run up to 6 million individuals. Unlike others of the group, black kites are opportunistic hunters and are more likely to scavenge. They spend much time soaring and gliding in thermals in search of food. Their angled wing and distinctive forked tail make them easy to identify. They are also vociferous with a shrill whinnying call. This kite is widely distributed through the temperate and tropical parts of Eurasia and parts of Australasia and Oceania, with the temperate region populations tending to be migratory. Several subspecies are recognized and formerly had their own English names. The European populations are small, but the South Asian population is very large.\n</p>\n\n\n<h2><span id=\"Systematics_and_taxonomy\">Systematics and taxonomy</span></h2>\n<p>The black kite was described by the French polymath Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon in his <i>Histoire Naturelle des Oiseaux</i> in 1770. The bird was also illustrated in a hand-coloured plate engraved by Fran\u00e7ois-Nicolas Martinet in the <i>Planches Enlumin\u00e9es D'Histoire Naturelle</i> which was produced under the supervision of Edme-Louis Daubenton to accompany Buffon's text. Neither the plate caption nor Buffon's description included a scientific name but in 1783 the Dutch naturalist Pieter Boddaert coined the binomial name <i>Falco migrans</i> in his catalogue of the <i>Planches Enlumin\u00e9es</i>. The type locality is France. The current genus <i>Milvus</i> was erected by the French naturalist Bernard Germain de Lac\u00e9p\u00e8de in 1799. <i>Milvus</i> is the Latin word for a red kite; the specific <i>migrans</i>  means \"migrating\" from the Latin <i>migrare</i> \"to migrate\".</p><p>The red kite has been known to hybridize with the black kite (in captivity where both species were kept together, and in the wild on the Cape Verde Islands).</p><p>Recent DNA studies suggest that the yellow-billed African races <i>parasitus</i> and <i>aegyptius</i> differ significantly from black kites in the Eurasian clade, and should be considered a separate allopatric species: yellow-billed kite, <i>M. aegyptius</i>. They occur throughout Africa except for the Congo basin and the Sahara Desert. There have been some suggestions that the black-eared kite (<i>M. m. lineatus</i>) should be elevated to full species status as <i>M. lineatus</i>, but this is not well supported.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Subspecies\">Subspecies</span></h3>\n<ul><li><i>M. m. migrans</i> \u2013 <small>(Boddaert, 1783)</small>: <b>European black kite</b></li></ul><dl><dd>Breeds central, southern and eastern Europe, as well as the Maghreb region of Northwest Africa, to Tien Shan and south to northwest Pakistan.

The sexes are alike. The upper plumage is brown but the head and neck tend to be paler. The patch behind the eye appears darker. The outer flight feathers are black and the feathers have dark cross bars and are mottled at the base. The lower parts of the body are pale brown, becoming lighter towards the chin. The body feathers have dark shafts giving it a streaked appearance. The cere and gape are yellow, but the bill is black (unlike in the yellow-billed kite). The legs are yellow and the claws are black. They have a distinctive shrill whistle followed by a rapid whinnying call. Males and females have the same plumage but females are longer than males. Their wingspan is around 150\u00a0cm.</p><p><br></p>\n<h2><span id=\"Distribution\">Distribution</span></h2>\n<p>The species is found in Europe, Asia, Africa and Australia. The temperate populations of this kite tend to be migratory while the tropical ones are resident. European and central Asian birds (subspecies <i>M. m. migrans</i> and <b>black-eared kite</b> <i>M. m. lineatus</i>, respectively) are migratory, moving to the tropics in winter, but races in warmer regions such as the Indian <i>M. m. govinda</i> (<b>small Indian/pariah kite</b>), or the Australasian <i>M. m. affinis</i> (<b>fork-tailed kite</b>), are resident. In some areas such as in the United Kingdom, the black kite occurs only as a wanderer on migration. These birds are usually of the nominate race, but in November 2006 a juvenile of the eastern <i>lineatus</i>, not previously recorded in western Europe, was found in Lincolnshire.</p><p>The species is not found in the Indonesian archipelago between the South East Asian mainland and the Wallace Line. Vagrants, most likely of the black-eared kite, on occasion range far into the Pacific, out to the Hawaiian islands.</p><p>In India, the population of <i>M. m. govinda</i> is particularly large especially in areas of high human population. Here the birds avoid heavily forested regions. A survey in 1967 in the 150 square kilometres of the city of New Delhi produced an estimate of about 2200 pairs or roughly 15 per square kilometre. Another survey in 2013 estimated 150 pairs for every 10 square kilometres.</p><p>Vagrants from Australia occasionally reach New Zealand, however, only one individual has persisted there (currently ~21 years old).</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Behaviour_and_ecology\">Behaviour and ecology</span></h2>\n<h3><span id=\"Food_and_foraging\">Food and foraging</span></h3>\n<p>Black kites are most often seen gliding and soaring on thermals as they search for food. The flight is Buoyancy and the bird glides with ease, changing directions easily. They will swoop down with their legs lowered to snatch small live prey, fish, household refuse and carrion, for which behaviour they are known in British military slang as the shite-hawk. They are opportunist hunters and have been known to take birds, bats, and rodents. They are attracted to smoke and fires, where they seek escaping prey. It has been claimed in native Australian beliefs, that kites spread fires by picking and dropping burning twigs so as to flush prey. The Indian populations are well adapted to living in cities and are found in densely populated areas. Large numbers may be seen soaring in thermals over cities. In some places, they will readily swoop and snatch food held by humans. Black kites in Spain prey on nestling waterfowl especially during summer to feed their young. Predation of nests of other pairs of black kites has also been noted. Kites have also been seen to tear and carry away the nests of baya weavers in an attempt to obtain eggs or chicks.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Flocking_and_roosting\">Flocking and roosting</span></h3>\n<p>In winter, kites form large communal roosts. Flocks may fly about before settling at the roost. When migrating, the black kite has a greater propensity to form large flocks than other migratory raptors, particularly prior to making a crossing across water. In India, the subspecies <i>govinda</i> shows large seasonal fluctuations with the highest numbers seen from July to October, after the monsoons, and it has been suggested that they make local movements in response to high rainfall.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Breeding\">Breeding</span></h3><p>\nThe breeding season of black kites in India begins in winter (mainly January and February), the young birds fledging before the monsoons. The nest is a rough platform of twigs and rags placed in a tree. Nest sites may be reused in subsequent years. European birds breed in summer. Birds in the Italian Alps tended to build their nest close to water in steep cliffs or tall trees. Nest orientation may be related to wind and rainfall. The nests may sometimes be decorated with bright materials such as white plastic and a study in Spain suggests that they may have a role in signalling to keep away other kites. After pairing, the male frequently copulates with the female. Unguarded females may be approached by other males, and extra pair copulations are frequent. Males returning from a foraging trip will frequently copulate on return, as this increases the chances of his sperm fertilizing the eggs rather than a different male. Both the male and female take part in nest building, incubation and care of chicks. The typical clutch size is 2 or sometimes 3 eggs. The incubation period varies from 30\u201334 days. Chicks of the Indian population stayed at the nest for nearly two months. Chicks hatched later in European populations appeared to fledge faster. The care of young by the parents also rapidly decreased with the need for adults to migrate. Siblings show aggression to each other and often the weaker chick may be killed, but parent birds were found to preferentially feed the smaller chicks in experimentally altered nests. Newly hatched young have down (prepennae) which are sepia on the back and black around the eye and buff on the head, neck and underparts. This is replaced by brownish-gray second down (preplumulae). After 9\u201312 days, the second down appears on the whole body except the top of the head. Body feathers begin to appear after 18 to 22 days. The feathers on the head become noticeable from the 24th to 29th day. The nestlings initially feed on food fallen at the bottom of the nest and begin to tear flesh after 33\u201339 days. They are able to stand on their legs after 17\u201319 days and begin flapping their wings after 27\u201331 days. After 50 days, they begin to move to branches next to the nest. Birds are able to breed after their second year. Parent birds guard their nest and will dive aggressively at intruders. Humans who intrude the nest appear to be recognized by birds and singled out for dive attacks.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Mortality_factors\">Mortality factors</span></h3>\n<p>Black-eared kites in Japan were found to accumulate nearly 70% of mercury accumulated from polluted food in the feathers, thus excreting it in the moult process. Black kites often perch on electric wires and are frequent victims of electrocution. Their habit of swooping to pick up dead rodents or other roadkill leads to collisions with vehicles. Instances of mass poisoning as a result of feeding on poisoned voles in agricultural fields have been noted. They are also a major nuisance at some airports, where their size makes them a significant birdstrike hazard.</p><p>As a large raptorial bird, the black kite has few natural predators. However, they do have a single serious predator: the Eurasian eagle-owl (<i>Bubo bubo</i>). The eagle-owl freely picks off kites of any age from the nestling stage to adulthood and were noted to precipitously decrease kite breeding success when nesting within kilometres of the kites in the Italian Alps. Like most bird species, they have parasites, several species of endoparasitic trematodes are known and some Digenea species that are transmitted via fishes.</p><p>Birds with abnormal development of a secondary upper mandible have been recorded in <i>govinda</i> and <i>lineatus</i>.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n\n<h2><span id=\"Further_reading\">Further reading</span></h2>\n<ul><li><cite id=\"CITEREFDesaiMalhotra1982\" class=\"citation journal\">Desai, J.H.; Malhotra, A.K.

The genus <i>Phoenicurus</i> was introduced by the English naturalist Thomas Forster in 1817. Both parts of the scientific name are from Ancient Greek and refer to the colour of the tail. The genus name <i>Phoenicurus</i> is from <i>phoinix</i>, \"red\", and <i>-ouros</i> -\"tailed\", and the specific <i>ochruros</i> is from <i>okhros</i>, \"pale yellow\" and <i>-ouros</i>.</p><p>The black redstart is a member of a temperate Eurasian clade which also includes the Daurian redstart, Hodgson's redstart, the white-winged redstart, and maybe Przevalski's redstart. The present species' ancestors diverged from about 3 million years ago (mya) (Late Pliocene) onwards and spread throughout much of Palearctic from 1.5 mya onward. It is not very closely related to the common redstart. As these are separated by different behaviour and ecological requirements and have not evolved fertilisation barriers, the two European species can nonetheless produce apparently fertile and viable hybrids.</p><p>There are a number of subspecies which differ mainly in underpart colours of the adult males; different authorities accept between five and seven subspecies.

The adult male is overall dark grey to black on the upperparts and with a black breast; the lower rump and tail are orange-red, with the two central tail feathers dark red-brown. The belly and undertail are either blackish-grey (western subspecies; see Taxonomy and systematics, above) or orange-red (eastern subspecies); the wings are blackish-grey with pale fringes on the secondaries forming a whitish panel (western subspecies) or all blackish (eastern subspecies). The female is grey (western subspecies) to grey-brown (eastern subspecies) overall except for the orange-red lower rump and tail, greyer than the common redstart; at any age the grey axillaries and underwing coverts are also distinctive (in the common redstart these are buff to orange-red). One-year-old males are similar to females but blacker; the whitish wing panel of the western subspecies does not develop until the second year.</p>\n\n<h2><span id=\"Distribution_and_habitat\">Distribution and habitat</span></h2>\n\n<p>It is a widespread breeder in south and central Europe and Asia and north-west Africa, from Great Britain and Ireland (where local) south to Morocco, east to central China. It is resident in the milder parts of its range, but north-eastern birds migrate to winter in southern and western Europe and Asia, and north Africa. It nests in crevices or holes in buildings.</p><p>In Britain, it is most common as a passage and winter visitor, with only 20\u201350 pairs breeding. On passage it is fairly common on the east and south coasts, and in winter on the coasts of Wales and western and southern England, with a few also at inland sites. Migrant black redstarts arrive in Britain in October or November and either move on or remain to winter, returning eastward in March or April. They also winter on the south and east coasts of Ireland.</p><p>The species originally inhabited stony ground in mountains, particularly cliffs, but since about 1900 has expanded to include similar urban habitats including bombed areas during and after World War II, and large industrial complexes that have the bare areas and cliff-like buildings it favours; in Great Britain, most of the small breeding population nests in such industrial areas. It will catch passing insects in flight, and migrants often hunt in coastal tide-wrack for flies or tiny crustaceans. Its quick ducks of head and body are robin-like, and its tail is often flicked. The male has a rattling song and a <i>tick</i> call.\n</p><p>Eastern race birds are very rare vagrants in western Europe.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Behaviour_and_ecology\">Behaviour and ecology</span></h2>\n<p>The black redstart is socially monogamous.

It was first described by Carl Linnaeus in the 10th edition of his <i>Systema Naturae</i>. Measuring on average 95 to 100\u00a0cm (37 to 39\u00a0in) from beak tip to end of tail with a 145-to-155\u00a0cm (57-to-61\u00a0in) wingspan, the adult black stork has mainly black plumage, with white underparts, long red legs and a long pointed red beak. A widespread but uncommon species, it breeds in scattered locations across Europe (predominantly in Portugal and Spain, and central and eastern parts), and east across the Palearctic to the Pacific Ocean. It is a long-distance migrant, with European populations wintering in tropical Sub-Saharan Africa, and Asian populations in the Indian subcontinent. When migrating between Europe and Africa, it avoids crossing the Mediterranean Sea and detours via the Levant in the east or the Strait of Gibraltar in the west. An isolated, non-migratory, population occurs in Southern Africa.\n</p><p>Unlike the closely related white stork, the black stork is a shy and wary species. It is seen singly or in pairs, usually in marshy areas, rivers or inland waters. It feeds on amphibians, small fish and insects, generally wading slowly in shallow water stalking its prey. Breeding pairs usually build nests in large forest trees\u2014most commonly deciduous but also coniferous\u2014which can be seen from long distances, as well as on large boulders, or under overhanging ledges in mountainous areas. The female lays two to five greyish-white eggs, which become soiled over time in the nest. Incubation takes 32 to 38 days,\u00a0with both sexes sharing duties, and fledging takes 60 to 71 days.\n</p><p>The black stork is considered to be a species of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, but its actual status is uncertain. Despite its large range, it is nowhere abundant, and it appears to be declining in parts of its range, such as in India, China and parts of Western Europe, though increasing in others such as the Iberian Peninsula. Various conservation measures have been taken for the black stork, like the Conservation Action Plan for African black storks by Wetlands International. It is also protected under the African-Eurasian Waterbird Agreement and the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora.\n</p>\n\n\n<h2><span id=\"Taxonomy_and_etymology\">Taxonomy and etymology</span></h2>\n<p>English naturalist Francis Willughby wrote about the black stork in the 17th century, having seen one in Frankfurt. He named it <i>Ciconia nigra</i>, from the Latin words for \"stork\" and \"black\" respectively. It was one of the many species originally described by Swedish zoologist Carl Linnaeus in the landmark 1758 10th edition of his <i>Systema Naturae</i>, where it was given the binomial name of <i>Ardea nigra</i>. It was moved to the new genus <i>Ciconia</i> by French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson two years later. The word <i>stork</i> is derived from the Old English word <i>storc</i>, thought to be related to the Old High German <i>storah</i>, meaning \"stork\", and the Old English <i>stearc</i>, meaning \"stiff\".</p>\n\n<p>The black stork is a member of the genus <i>Ciconia</i>, or typical storks, a group of seven extant species, characterised by straight bills and mainly black and white plumage. The black stork was long thought to be most closely related to the white stork (<i>C. ciconia</i>). However, genetic analysis via DNA\u2013DNA hybridization and mitochondrial cytochrome b DNA by Beth Slikas in 1997 found that it was basal (an early offshoot) in the genus <i>Ciconia</i>. Fossil remains have been recovered from Miocene beds on Rusinga and Maboko Islands in Kenya, which are indistinguishable from the white and black storks.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Description\">Description</span></h2>\n\n<p>The black stork is a large bird, measuring between 95 and 100\u00a0cm (37 and 39\u00a0in) in length with a 145-to-155\u00a0cm (57-to-61\u00a0in) wingspan, and weighing around 3\u00a0kg (6.6\u00a0lb). Standing as tall as 102\u00a0cm (40\u00a0in), it has long red legs, a long neck and a long, straight, pointed red beak. It bears some resemblance to Abdim's stork (<i>C. abdimii</i>), which can be distinguished by its much smaller build, predominantly green bill, legs and feet, and white rump and lower back. The plumage is black with a purplish green sheen, except for the white lower breast, belly, armpits, axillaries and undertail coverts. The breast feathers are long and shaggy, forming a ruff which is used in some courtship displays. The black stork has brown irises, and bare red skin around its eyes. The sexes are identical in appearance, except that males are larger than females on average. Moulting takes place in spring, with the iridescent sheen brighter in new plumage. It walks slowly and steadily on the ground and like all storks, it flies with its neck outstretched.</p><p>The juvenile resembles the adult in plumage, but the areas corresponding to the adult black feathers are browner and less glossy. The scapulars, wing and upper tail coverts have pale tips. The legs, bill and bare skin around the eyes are greyish green. It could possibly be confused with the juvenile yellow-billed stork, but the latter has paler wings and mantle, a longer bill and white under the wings.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Distribution_and_habitat\">Distribution and habitat</span></h2>\n\n<p>During the summer, the black stork is found from Eastern Asia (Siberia and northern China) west to Central Europe, reaching Estonia in the north, Poland, Lower Saxony and Bavaria in Germany, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Italy and Greece in the south, with an outlying population in the central-southwest region of the Iberian Peninsula (Extremadura and surrounding provinces of Spain, plus Portugal). It is migratory, wintering in tropical Africa and Asia, although certain populations of black storks are sedentary or dispersive. An isolated population exists in Southern Africa, where the species is more numerous in the east, in eastern South Africa and Mozambique, and is also found in Zimbabwe, Swaziland, Botswana and less commonly Namibia.</p><p>Most of the black storks that summer in Europe migrate to Africa, with those from western Germany and points west heading south via the Iberian Peninsula and the rest via Turkey and the Levant. Those flying via Spain spend winter in the Fal\u00e9m\u00e9 River basin of eastern Senegal, Guinea, southern Mauritania, Ivory Coast, Sierra Leone and western and central Mali, while those flying via the Sinai end up in northern Ethiopia, the Kotto River basin in the Central African Republic, the Mbokou river basin in Chad and northeastern Nigeria. Black storks summering in western Asia migrate to northern and northeastern India, ranging mainly from Punjab south to Karnataka, and Africa. They are occasional visitors to Sri Lanka. Those summering further east in eastern Russia and China winter mainly in southern China, and occasionally in Hong Kong, Myanmar, northern Thailand, and Laos. They were first recorded in western Myanmar in 1998.</p><p>The black stork prefers more wooded areas than the better-known white stork, and breeds in large marshy wetlands with interspersed coniferous or broadleaved woodlands, but also inhabits hills and mountains with sufficient networks of creeks. It usually inhabits ponds, rivers, edges of lakes, estuaries and other freshwater wetlands. The black stork does inhabit more agricultural areas in the Caspian lowlands, but even here it avoids close contact with people. Its wintering habitat in India comprises reservoirs or rivers with nearby scrub or forest, which provide trees that black storks can roost in at night. In southern Africa it is found in shallow water in rivers or lakes, or swamps, but is occasionally encountered on dry land.</p><p>After disappearing from Belgium before the onset of the 20th century, it has returned to breed in the Belgian Ardennes, Luxembourg and Burgundy, France, by 2000. It appears to be increasing in numbers in Spain and Portugal, where the population was estimated at 405 to 483 pairs in 2006. The black stork is a rare vagrant to the British Isles, turning up in the warmer months\u2014particularly in spring\u2014generally in the south and east. Sightings have become more common since the 1970s as its breeding range moves northwards. It has been recorded in Scotland six times between 1946 and 1983, including from Shetland, Orkney and the Highlands, as well as the Scottish Borders (Peebles). It is not abundant in the western parts of its distribution, but more densely inhabits eastern Transcaucasia. Further east, it has been recorded from locations across Iran, though little is known about its habits there; breeding has been recorded from near Aliabad in Fars province, Khabr National Park in Kerman province, Karun river in Khuzestan province, Qaranqu River in East Azarbaijan province, and Aliabad river in Razavi Khorasan province. The population has declined in Iran due to draining of wetlands. East of the Ural Mountains, the black stork is patchily found in forested and mountainous areas up to 60\u00b0\u201263\u00b0 N across Siberia to the Pacific Ocean. South of Siberia, it breeds in Xinjiang, northwestern China, northern Mongolia south to the Altai Mountains, and northeastern China south to the vicinity of Beijing. In the Korean Peninsula, the black stork is an uncommon summer visitor, no longer breeding in the south since 1966. Birds have been seen in the northeast but it is not known whether they breed there. Similarly it has been seen in the summer in Afghanistan, but its breeding status is uncertain.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Migration\">Migration</span></h3>\n\n<p>Migration takes place from early August to October, with a major exodus in September. Some of the Iberian populations, and also those in southern Africa, are essentially non-migratory, though they may wander freely in the non-breeding areas. A broad-winged soaring bird, the black stork is assisted by thermals of hot air for long-distance flight, although is less dependent on them than is the white stork. Since thermals only form over land, the black stork, together with large raptors, must cross the Mediterranean at the narrowest points, and many black storks travel south through the Bosphorus, as well as the Sinai and Gibraltar. The trip is around 5,667\u00a0km (3,521\u00a0mi) via the western route and 7,000\u00a0km (4,300\u00a0mi) via the eastern route, with satellite tracking yielding an average travel time of 37 and 80 days respectively. The western route goes over the Rock of Gibraltar or over the Bay of Gibraltar, generally on a southwesterly track that takes them to the central part of the strait, from where they reach Morocco. Many birds fly around the Sahara next to the coast. About 10% of the western storks choose the passage Sicily \u2013 Cap Bon, Tunisia.</p><p>Spain contains several important areas\u2014Monfrag\u00fce National Park, Sierra de Gredos Regional Park, National Hunting Reserve in C\u00edjara, Natural Park of the Sierra Hornachuelos and Do\u00f1ana National Park\u2014where black storks stop over on the western migration route. Pesticide use has threatened birdlife in nearby Do\u00f1ana. Further south, Lake Faguibine in Mali is another stopover point but it has been affected by drought in recent years.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Behaviour\">Behaviour</span></h2>\n<p>A wary species, the black stork avoids contact with people. It is generally found alone or in pairs, or in flocks of up to a hundred birds when migrating, or during winter.</p><p>The black stork has a wider range of calls than the white stork, its main call being a <i>chee leee</i>, which sounds like a loud inhalation. It makes a hissing call as a warning or threat. Displaying males produce a long series of wheezy raptor-like squealing calls rising in volume and then falling. It rarely indulges in mutual bill-clattering when adults meet at the nest. Adults will do so as part of their mating ritual or when angered. The young clatter their bills when aroused.</p><p>The <i>up-down display</i> is used for a number of interactions with other members of the species. Here a stork positions its body horizontally and quickly bobs its head up from down-facing to around 30 degrees above horizontal and back again, while displaying the white segments of its plumage prominently, and this is repeated several times. The display is used as a greeting between birds, and\u2014more vigorously\u2014as a threat display. The species' solitary nature means that this threat display is rarely witnessed.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Breeding\">Breeding</span></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The black stork breeds between April and May in the Northern Hemisphere, with eggs usually laid in late April. In southern Africa, breeding takes place in the months between September and March, possibly to take advantage of abundant water prey rendered easier to catch as the rivers dry up and recede\u2014from April and May in Zimbabwe, Botswana and northern South Africa, and as late as July further south.</p><p>Pairs in courtship have aerial displays that appear to be unique among the storks. Paired birds soared in parallel, usually over the nest territory early in the mornings or late afternoons with one bird splaying the white undertail coverts to the sides of the narrowed black tail and the pair calls to each other. These courtship flights are difficult to see due to the densely forested habitat in which they breed. The nest is large, constructed from sticks and twigs, and sometimes also large branches, at an elevation of 4\u201325\u00a0m (13\u201382\u00a0ft). The black stork prefers to construct its nest in forest trees with large canopies where the nest can be built far from the main trunk\u2014generally in places far from human disturbance. For the most part, deciduous trees are chosen for nesting sites, though conifers are used as well. A 2003 field study in Estonia found that the black stork preferred oak (<i>Quercus robur</i>), European aspen (<i>Populus tremula</i>), and to a lesser extent Scots pine (<i>Pinus sylvestris</i>), and ignored Norway spruce (<i>Picea abies</i>), in part due to the canopy structure of the trees. Trees with nests averaged around 25.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.2 metres (84\u00a0\u00b1\u00a017\u00a0ft) high and had a diameter at breast height of 66\u00a0\u00b1\u00a020 centimetres (26.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.9\u00a0in). Furthermore, 90% of the trees chosen were at least 80 years old, highlighting the importance of conserving old-growth forests. A 2004 field study of nesting sites in Dadia-Lefkimi-Soufli National Park in north-eastern Greece found that it preferred the Calabrian pine (<i>Pinus brutia</i>), which had large side branches that allowed it to build the nest away from the trunk, as well as black pine (<i>Pinus nigra</i>) and to a lesser extent Turkey oak (<i>Quercus cerris</i>). It chose the largest trees in an area, generally on steeper ground and near streams. Trees chosen were on average over 90 years old. In the Iberian peninsula it nests in pine and cork oak (<i>Quercus suber</i>).</p><p>\nIn steeply mountainous areas such as parts of Spain, South Africa and the Carpathian Mountains it nests on cliffs, on large boulders, in caves and under overhanging ledges. The black stork's solitary nests are usually at least 1\u00a0km (0.6\u00a0mi) apart, even where the species is numerous. Although newly constructed nests may be significantly smaller, older nests can be 1\u20132\u00a0m (3.3\u20136.6\u00a0ft) in diameter. In southern Africa, the black stork may occupy the nests of other bird species such as\u00a0hamerkop (<i>Scopus umbretta</i>)\u00a0or Verreaux's eagle (<i>Aquila verreauxi</i>) and commonly reuses them in successive years. They are repaired with earth and grass, and lined with leaves, moss, grass, animal fur, paper, clay and rags.</p><p> In a clutch, there are two to five, or rarely even six large oval grey-white eggs, which become soiled during incubation. They can be 64\u201370\u00a0mm (2.5\u20132.8\u00a0in) long and 50\u201353\u00a0mm (2.0\u20132.1\u00a0in) wide, averaging about 68\u00a0mm (2.7\u00a0in) in length and 52\u00a0mm (2.0\u00a0in) in width.\u00a0The eggs are laid with an interval of two days. Hatching is asynchronous, and takes place at the end of May. Incubation\u00a0takes 32 to 38 days,\u00a0with both sexes sharing duties, which commence after the first or second egg is laid. The young start flying by the end of July. Fledging takes 60 to 71 days, after which the young joins the adults at their feeding grounds. However, for another two weeks, the young continue to return to the nest, to be fed and to roost at night.</p><p>At least one adult remains in the nest for two to three weeks after hatching to protect the young. Both parents feed the young by regurgitating onto the floor of the nest. Black stork parents have been known to kill one of their fledglings, generally the weakest, in times of food shortage to reduce brood size and hence increase the chance of survival of the remaining nestlings. Stork nestlings do not attack each other, and their parents' method of feeding them (disgorging large amounts of food at once) means that stronger siblings cannot outcompete weaker ones for food directly, hence parental infanticide is an efficient way of reducing brood size. This behaviour has only rarely been observed in the species, although the shyness of the species and difficulties in studying its nesting habits mean that it might not be an uncommon phenomenon.</p><p>Ringing recovery studies in Europe suggests that nearly 20% of chicks reach the breeding stage, around 3 years, and about 10% live beyond 10 years and about 5% beyond 20 years. Captive individuals have lived for as long as 36 years.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Feeding\">Feeding</span></h3>\n<p>The black stork mainly eats fish, including small cyprinids, pikes, roaches, eels, budds, perches, burbots, sticklebacks and muddy loaches (<i>Misgurnus</i> and <i>Cobitis</i>). It may feed on amphibians, small reptiles, crabs, mammals and birds, and invertebrates such as snails, molluscs, earthworms, and insects like water beetles and their larvae.</p><p>Foraging for food takes place mostly in fresh water, though the black stork may look for food on dry land at times. The black stork wades patiently and slowly in shallow water, often alone or in a small group if food is plentiful. It has been observed shading the water with its wings while hunting. In India, it often forages in mixed species flocks with the white stork, woolly-necked stork (<i>Ciconia episcopus</i>), demoiselle crane (<i>Grus virgo</i>) and bar-headed goose (<i>Anser indicus</i>). The black stork also follows large mammals such as deer and livestock, presumably to eat the invertebrates and small animals flushed by their presence.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Parasites_and_symbionts\">Parasites and symbionts</span></h3>\n<p>More than 12 species of parasitic helminth have been recorded from black storks with <i>Cathaemasia hians</i> and <i>Dicheilonema ciconiae</i> reported to be the most dominant. The juvenile black stork, although having a less diverse helminth population, is parasitized more frequently than the adult. A species of <i>Corynebacterium</i>\u2014<i>C. ciconiae</i>\u2014was isolated and described from the trachea of healthy black storks, and is thought to be part of the natural flora of the species. A herpes virus is known from black storks. Birdlice that have been recorded on the species include <i>Neophilopterus tricolor, Colpocephalum nigrae,</i> and <i>Ardeicola maculatus.</i> A diverse array of predatory mesostigmatid mites\u2014particularly the genera <i>Dendrolaelaps</i> and <i>Macrocheles</i>\u2014have been recovered from black stork nests. Their role is unknown, though they could prey on parasitic arthropods.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Status_and_conservation\">Status and conservation</span></h2>\n<p>Since 1998, the black stork has been rated as a species of\u00a0least concern\u00a0on the\u00a0IUCN Red List\u00a0of Endangered Species. This is because it has a large range\u2014more than 20,000\u00a0km<sup>2</sup>\u00a0(7,700\u00a0mi<sup>2</sup>)\u2014and because its population is thought not to have declined by 30% over ten years or three generations and thus is not a rapid enough decline to warrant a vulnerable rating. Even so, the state of the population overall is unclear, and although it is widespread, it is not abundant anywhere. Black stork numbers have declined for many years in western Europe, and the species has already been extirpated from Scandinavia. The population in India\u2014a major wintering ground\u2014is declining. Previously a regular winter visitor to the Mai Po Marshes, it is now seldom seen there, and appears to be in decline in China overall. Its habitat is changing rapidly in much of eastern Europe and Asia. Various conservation measures have been taken, including Wetlands International's Conservation Action Plan for African black storks, which focuses on improving the wintering conditions of the birds which breed in Europe. It is protected by the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA) and the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES).</p><p>Hunters threaten the black stork in some countries of southern Europe and Asia, such as Pakistan, and breeding populations may have been eliminated there. The black stork vanished from the Ticino River valley in northern Italy, with hunting a likely contributor. In 2005, black storks were released into the Parco Lombardo del Ticino in an attempt to re-establish the species there.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Notes\">Notes</span></h2>\n\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n\n<h3><span id=\"Cited_texts\">Cited texts</span></h3>\n<ul><li><cite id=\"CITEREFCramp1977\" class=\"citation book\">Cramp, Stanley, ed.

The species was described in 1836, from a specimen collected in Nepal. It is a medium-sized forktail, weighing between 25 and 29 grams, with a length of 20.5 to 23 centimetres (<span>8<span>\u00a0</span><sup>1</sup>\u2044<sub>8</sub></span> to 9\u00a0in). The species has a broad white stripe across its forehead. The crown, face, and mantle are black, while the bird's underparts are white, sharply divided from the black above. The wings are largely black with a broad white stripe across the greater coverts. The tail of the species, similar to that of other forktails, is long, graduated, and deeply forked. The tail is black with a white tip and three white bands created by shorter tail feathers. The beak of the bird is black, while the feet and legs are light pink, and the iris is brown. The species is monomorphic.\n</p><p>The black backed forktail is solitary, but is occasionally found in pairs or in family groups. It is described as a shy species. The bird breeds between March and June, building a nest of plant matter in holes or crevices in rocks and dead trees. Three eggs are generally laid, which are pink and spotted with red-brown. Both sexes build the nest and incubate the eggs. The species frequents fast-flowing rivers and streams in temperate forests and subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests. It is found in the Indian subcontinent and in some adjoining regions of Southeast Asia. It ranges across Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Myanmar, Nepal and Thailand. It is generally found below 1,450 metres (4,760\u00a0ft) above sea level, but has been recorded as high as 2,600 metres (8,530\u00a0ft). Its precise range and population are unknown. It is classified as a species of Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.\n</p>\n\n\n<h2><span id=\"Taxonomy\">Taxonomy</span></h2>\n<p>British naturalist Brian H. Hodgson scientifically described the black-backed forktail in 1836, from a specimen obtained in Nepal. It was originally placed in a new subgenus <i>Enicurus</i> in the genus <i>Motacilla</i>, which contains the wagtails. Hodgson described the species as sharing the characteristics of the genera <i>Motacilla</i> and <i>Turdus</i>, having an intermediate morphology, a general shape closer to that of <i>Turdus</i> species, and behavior closer to that of <i>Motacilla</i>. The species is currently placed within the family Muscicapidae, which includes Old World flycatchers and chats. The species has been referred to as the black-throated forktail.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Description\">Description</span></h2>\n<p>A medium-sized forktail, the black-backed forktail is between 20.5 and 23 centimetres (<span>8<span>\u00a0</span><sup>1</sup>\u2044<sub>8</sub></span> and 9\u00a0in). It weighs between 25 and 29 grams. The length of the wing has been recorded as between 8.6 and 9.8 centimetres (<span>3<span>\u00a0</span><sup>3</sup>\u2044<sub>8</sub></span> and <span>3<span>\u00a0</span><sup>7</sup>\u2044<sub>8</sub></span>\u00a0in) in the male and 8.6 to 9.0 centimetres (<span>3<span>\u00a0</span><sup>3</sup>\u2044<sub>8</sub></span> to <span>3<span>\u00a0</span><sup>1</sup>\u2044<sub>2</sub></span>\u00a0in) in the female. The bill extends 2 centimetres (<span><sup>3</sup>\u2044<sub>4</sub></span>\u00a0in) from the skull, while the tail is between 12.4 and 12.7 centimetres (<span>4<span>\u00a0</span><sup>7</sup>\u2044<sub>8</sub></span> and 5\u00a0in) long.</p><p>The species has a broad white stripe beginning just behind the eyes and running across its forehead. The crown and mantle are completely covered in black feathering, which extends down to the upper forehead, face, scapulars, throat, and sides of the neck. The underparts of the bird are white, sharply delineated from the black of the throat. The lesser coverts and median coverts are completely black, as are the bases of the greater coverts. A broad white band runs across the wing, running across the greater coverts as well as the bases of the inner secondary and tertiary feathers. The highest tertial feather is white, and the inner primaries have white tips and the base of the secondaries are covered in a small white patch. The flight feathers are otherwise black. As with most other forktails, the tail of the species is long, graduated, and deeply forked. The feathers are black, with white tips, except for the outermost feathers, which are white. The tail has a white tip and three white bands created by the ends of shorter tail feathers. The beak of the species is black, while the feet and legs are whitish-pink or a light flesh colour. The iris is brown or dark brown.</p><p>The black-backed forktail does not exhibit sexual dimorphism, and has no known geographic variation in its appearance. Nothing is known of its moulting. Juveniles of the species lack the prominent white stripe across the forehead, and the areas that are black on the adult are sooty brown or dull black. Juveniles have a white spot behind the eye, and may have dark scales or speckles on its flanks, breast, and belly. The tail of the juvenile is usually shorter, while the mandible is yellowish, and the maxilla have whitish cutting edges.</p><p>The bird is similar to the slaty-backed forktail, but lacks the slaty back of the latter, and is also smaller in size. It also has a slimmer bill. The white band on its face is narrower than that of the otherwise similar white-crowned forktail: it is also distinguished by its white, rather than black, breast. Field identification guides describe it as being the same size as bulbul species. Its call is described as a short and whistled \"tseep - dew\" or \"hurt-zeee\". The two syllables of this call are sometimes produced separately, as a hollow \"huu\" and a shrill \"zeee\", which are somewhat higher pitched than the call of the slaty-backed forktail. It produces a two syllable call when disturbed. It also makes a call similar to that of the slaty-backed forktail, described as being reminiscent of a squeaky hinge. It has been described as occasionally producing a short song as well.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Behavior_and_ecology\">Behavior and ecology</span></h2>\n<p>The species is solitary, or occasionally found in pairs, but may be seen in family groups during the breeding season. Described as a shy bird, it often bobs its tail when feeding, and when at rest opens and closes it with a scissor-like motion. It habitually flies along the course of a river or stream, and its flight is described as quick and straight, occasionally undulating slightly. It has been observed near waterfalls. The precise diet of the black-backed forktail is unknown, but it has been observed to consume aquatic insects, the larvae of these insects, and crustaceans. It typically forages along fast-moving streams and rivers, including on rocks in midstream, and may occasionally enter the water. It may also forage along slower-moving rivers, ponds, or forest pools, and has been recorded as foraging in damp areas of the forest. When inactive, it has been observed to remain in bushes or low shrubbery.</p><p>The breeding season of the black-backed forktail is between March and June. The nest consists of a cup constructed of plant matter, including dried leaves, moss, and fibres, sometimes lined with leaf skeletons. It may be located in the hole of a dead tree, under a bank, on a ledge, or in a hole or cleft among rocks. Usually, three eggs are laid, which are pinkish and sparsely specked with fine red-brown. The speckles occasionally form blotches or caps at the end of the eggs. The eggs have been recorded as averaging 2.08 centimetres (<span><sup>7</sup>\u2044<sub>8</sub></span>\u00a0in) in length and 1.58 centimetres (<span><sup>5</sup>\u2044<sub>8</sub></span>\u00a0in) in width. Both male and female birds participate in the construction of the nest and in incubation. Though the species is largely sedentary, first-year birds disperse from their parental breeding areas between April and October.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Range_and_distribution\">Range and distribution</span></h2>\n<p>The black-backed forktail's habitat of choice is near fast-flowing rivers and streams in moist tropical broadleaf forest and subtropical lowland forest. It frequents rocks and boulders within or bordering streams, as well as mud or sand banks bordering rapidly moving stretches of water. The western end of the species's range is in Garhwal, in the northwest portion of the Indian state of Uttarakhand. The range extends from there through western and central Nepal to Bhutan and the northeastern Indian states, including Sikkim, Assam, Meghalaya, Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, and Manipur. It is known as a winter visitor to Nameri National Park in Assam. West of Sikkim the species is uncommon, but it is common in Bhutan. It is also found in the Sylhet and Chittagong regions of Bangladesh, where it is uncommon. The range extends to Myanmar, except for the region of Tenasserim, and to northwestern Thailand. It has also been reported from southwestern Yunnan in China, and from southeastern Tibet. Birdlife International maps its range as being contiguous over these regions, except for an area in south Myanmar separated from the rest of the range. Field guides for birds in south Asia describe its distribution as discontinuous.</p><p>In the western part of its range the species is found up to 1,450 metres (4,760\u00a0ft) above sea level; in the eastern part, up to 900 metres (2,950\u00a0ft) above sea level. In Nepal its elevational range is described as 75 to 1,370 metres (250 to 4,500\u00a0ft) above sea level. In 1998 the species was recorded at 2,600 metres (8,500\u00a0ft) above sea level in Eaglenest Wildlife Sanctuary in Arunachal Pradesh. It breeds largely below 600 metres (1,970\u00a0ft) in India and Bhutan. The population of the species is unknown, but is believed to be stable, and larger than 10,000 individuals.  Its precise range is also unknown, but is thought to be larger than 20,000 square kilometres. These estimates have led to its being classified as a species of Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n\n<h2><span id=\"External_links\">External links</span></h2>\n<ul><li> Data related to <i>Enicurus immaculatus</i> at Wikispecies</li>\n<li> Media related to <span><i>Enicurus immaculatus</i></span> at Wikimedia Commons</li></ul>"

They can sometimes resemble whiskered terns (<i>Chlidonias hybrida</i>), but the deeper fork of the tail and the black on the lower belly distinguish them from the shallow fork and black closer to the breast on the whiskered tern. Considering that sequence analysis supports moving the similar black-fronted tern (<i>\"Sterna\" albostriata</i>) into <i>Chlidonias</i>, this species might also be better placed in that genus, but no research has yet been conducted.</p>\n\n\n<h2><span id=\"Description\">Description</span></h2>\n<p>The black-bellied tern grows to a length of 32 to 35\u00a0cm (13 to 14\u00a0in). In the breeding plumage, the crown and nape are black and the upper parts are pale grey. The throat is white and the breast pale grey, gradually darkening to a black belly. The wings are long, slender and pointed and the tail is deeply forked with sharply pointed tips. The bill and feet are yellow or orange and the iris is reddish brown. Outside the breeding season, the belly is whitish, the tail is reduced in length and the bill has a dark tip.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Distribution_and_habitat\">Distribution and habitat</span></h2>\n<p>The species occurs mostly in Pakistan, Nepal, India and Bangladesh, with a separate range in Myanmar. Its typical habitat is lowland rivers and marshes, and sometimes ditches and pools, at altitudes of up to about 730\u00a0m (2,400\u00a0ft). It is an entirely inland species and is not found on the coast.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Ecology\">Ecology</span></h2>\n<p>The black-bellied tern has long wings but its flight is slow, with much flapping. It feeds on insects and small fish, skimming over the surface of the water and ground to pick up insects, and plunging obliquely into the water to feed on crustaceans, tadpoles and fish. Breeding takes place from February to April, the nesting site usually being a flat sandy location near a river or lake, a sand spit or a sandy island. It does not nest colonially but may nest with other birds such as river terns (<i>Sterna aurantia</i>), pratincoles (<i>Glareola</i> spp.) and Indian skimmers (<i>Rynchops albicollis</i>).</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Status\">Status</span></h2>\n<p><i>S. acuticauda</i> is classified as being endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. The rationale behind this is that the riverine habitats in which it breeds are under threat in much of southeastern Asia and, although it has an extensive range, it is believed to be extinct in southern China, Nepal, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam. Only in Pakistan, India and Bangladesh are there larger populations, and even in these countries, this bird is thought to be seriously declining, and there may be fewer than one thousand mature individuals in existence. The threats it faces include the degradation of the islands and sandspits on which it breeds, the collection of eggs for food, predation of eggs and chicks by dogs, cats and crows, flooding of nesting sites by the construction of river dams, competition for fish by local fishermen, entanglement in nets, disturbance, extraction of water, sand and gravel dredging and pollution.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2> "

This most northerly of the tree kingfishers is resident over much of its range, but northern populations are migratory, wintering south of their range in Sri Lanka, Thailand, Borneo and Java. It is distinctive in having a black cap that contrasts with the whitish throat, purple-blue wings and the coral red bill. The species is mainly found in coastal and mangrove habitats but can sometimes be found far inland.\n</p>\n\n\n<h2><span id=\"Taxonomy\">Taxonomy</span></h2>\n<p>The black-capped kingfisher was described by the French polymath Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon in his <i>Histoire Naturelle des Oiseaux</i> in 1780. The bird was also illustrated in a hand-coloured plate engraved by Fran\u00e7ois-Nicolas Martinet in the <i>Planches Enlumin\u00e9es D'Histoire Naturelle</i>, which was produced under the supervision of Edme-Louis Daubenton to accompany Buffon's text.  Neither the plate caption nor Buffon's description included a scientific name, but in 1783 the Dutch naturalist Pieter Boddaert coined the binomial name <i>Alcedo pileata</i> in his catalogue of the <i>Planches Enlumin\u00e9es</i>. The type locality is China. The present genus <i>Halcyon</i> was introduced by the English naturalist and artist William John Swainson in 1821. <i>Halcyon</i> is a name for a bird in Greek mythology  generally associated with the kingfisher. The specific epithet <i>pileata</i> is from the Latin <i>pileatus</i> meaning '-capped'. The species is monotypic.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Description\">Description</span></h2>\n\n<p>This kingfisher is about 28 centimetres (11\u00a0in) long. The adult has purple-blue wings and back, black head and shoulders, white neck collar and throat, and rufous underparts. The large bill and legs are bright red. In flight, large white patches or \"mirrors\" at the base of the primaries are visible on the blue and black wings. Sexes are similar, but juveniles are a duller version of the adult and show streaks on the throat. The call of this kingfisher is a cackling <i>ki-ki-ki-ki-ki</i>.\n</p><p>Usually seen on coastal waters and especially in mangroves, it is easily disturbed. It perches conspicuously and dives to catch fish, and also feeds on large insects. The flight of the black-capped kingfisher is rapid and direct, the short rounded wings whirring.\n</p><p>The breeding season is in summer. The nest is a tunnel in an earth bank. A single clutch of 4-5 round, white eggs is typical.</p><p>A subspecies <i>palawanensis</i> has been described, but the species is considered to be monotypic with no clear plumage differences across its range.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Distribution_and_habitat\">Distribution and habitat</span></h2>\n<p>The species is found mainly near the coast in mangrove forests and along estuaries and rivers. The distribution ranges from India (including the Andaman and Nicobar Islands where they occur even on remote islands like Narcondam), Sri Lanka, Kansu, Shansi, Korea, Malay Peninsula, Thailand, Burma, Ryukyu Islands, Hainan, Philippines (Palawan, Balabac, Basilan, Tawi Tawi), Borneo, Sumatra east to Sulawesi where it occurs only in winter.

They have a black crown and back with the remainder of the body white or grey, red eyes, and short yellow legs. They have pale grey wings and white under parts. Two or three long white plumes, erected in greeting and courtship displays, extend from the back of the head. The sexes are similar in appearance although the males are slightly larger. Black-crowned night herons do not fit the typical body form of the heron family. They are relatively stocky with shorter bills, legs, and necks than their more familiar cousins, the egrets and \"day\" herons. Their resting posture is normally somewhat hunched but when hunting they extend their necks and look more like other wading birds.\n</p><p>Immature birds have dull grey-brown plumage on their heads, wings, and backs, with numerous pale spots. Their underparts are paler and streaked with brown. The young birds have orange eyes and duller yellowish-green legs. They are very noisy birds in their nesting colonies, with calls that are commonly transcribed as <i>quok</i> or <i>woc</i>.\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Distribution\">Distribution</span></h2>\n<p>The breeding habitat is fresh and salt-water wetlands throughout much of the world. The subspecies <i>N. n. hoactli</i> breeds in North and South America from Canada as far south as northern Argentina and Chile, <i>N. n. obscurus</i> in southernmost South America, <i>N. n. falklandicus</i> in the Falkland Islands, and the nominate race <i>N. n. nycticorax</i> in Europe, Asia and Africa. Black-crowned night herons nest in colonies on platforms of sticks in a group of trees, or on the ground in protected locations such as islands or reedbeds. Three to eight eggs are laid.\n</p><p>This heron is migratory in the northernmost part of its range, but otherwise resident (even in the cold Patagonia). The North American population winters in Mexico, the southern United States, Central America, and the West Indies, and the Old World birds winter in tropical Africa and southern Asia.\n</p><p>A colony of the herons has regularly summered at the National Zoo in Washington, D.C. for more than a century.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Status_in_Great_Britain\">Status in Great Britain</span></h3>\n<p>There are two archaeological specimens of the black-crowned night heron in Great Britain. The oldest is from the Roman London Wall and the more recent from the Royal Navy's late medieval victualling yards in Greenwich  It appears in the London poulterers price lists as the Brewe, a bird which was thought to have been the Eurasian whimbrel or Glossy ibis,  which has now been shown to refer to the black-crowned night heron, derived from the medieval French <i>Bihoreau</i>.   Black-crowned night heron may have bred in the far wetter and wider landscape of pre-modern Britain.  They were certainly imported for the table so the bone specimens themselves do not prove they were part of the British avifauna.  In modern times the Black-crowned Night Heron is a vagrant and feral breeding colonies were established at Edinburgh Zoo from 1950 into the 21st Century and at Great Witchingham in Norfolk where there were 8 pairs in 2003 but breeding was not repeated in 2004 or 2005. A pair of adults were seen with two recently fledged juveniles in Somerset in 2017, which is the first proven breeding record of wild black-crowned night herons in Great Britain.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Behaviour\">Behaviour</span></h2>\n<p>These birds stand still at the water's edge and wait to ambush prey, mainly at night or early morning. They primarily eat small fish, crustaceans, frogs, aquatic insects, small mammals, and small birds. They are among the seven heron species observed to engage in bait fishing; luring or distracting fish by tossing edible or inedible buoyant objects into water within their striking range \u2013 a rare example of tool use among birds. During the day they rest in trees or bushes. <i>N. n. hoactli</i> is more gregarious outside the breeding season than the nominate race.\n</p>\n<ul class=\"gallery mw-gallery-traditional\"><li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\">\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\">\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\">\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\">\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\">\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\">\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\">\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\">\n</ul><h2><span id=\"Parasites\">Parasites</span></h2>\n<p>A thorough study performed by J. Sitko and P. Heneberg in the Czech Republic in 1962\u20132013 suggested that the central European black-crowned night herons host 8 helminth species. The dominant species consisted of <i>Neogryporhynchus cheilancristrotus</i> (62% prevalence), <i>Contracaecum microcephalum</i> (55% prevalence) and <i>Opistorchis longissimus</i> (10% prevalence). The mean number of helminth species recorded per host individual reached 1.41. In Ukraine, other helminth species are often found in black-crowned night herons too, namely <i>Echinochasmus beleocephalus</i>, <i>Echinochasmus ruficapensis</i>, <i>Clinostomum complanatum</i> and <i>Posthodiplostomum cuticola</i>.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Etymology\">Etymology</span></h2>\n<p><i>Nycticorax</i> means \"night raven\" and derives from the Ancient Greek <i>nuktos</i> \"night\" and <i>korax</i>, \"raven\".

It breeds in south-east Europe east to Iran and migrates in winter mainly to India, with some individuals moving further into south-east Asia. Like others in its family, it is found in open grassland habitats where they fly in flocks in search of grains and seed. Adult males are well marked with yellow underparts, chestnut back and a black head. Adult females in breeding plumage look like duller males. In other plumages, they can be hard to separate from the closely related red-headed bunting and natural hybridization occurs between the two species in the zone of overlap of their breeding ranges in northern Iran.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span id=\"Etymology\">Etymology</span></h2>\n<p>The genus name <i>Emberiza</i> is from Old German <i>Embritz</i>, a bunting, and the specific <i>melanocephala</i> is from Ancient Greek <i>melas</i>, \"black\", and <i>kephale</i> \"head\".</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Description\">Description</span></h2>\n<p>This bird is 15\u00a0cm long, larger than reed bunting, and long-tailed. The breeding male has bright yellow underparts, chestnut upperparts and a black hood. The female is a washed-out version of the male, with paler underparts, a grey-brown back and a greyish head. The juvenile is similar but the vent is yellow, and both can be difficult to separate from the corresponding plumages of the closely related red-headed bunting although the black-headed tends to have the cheeks darker than the throat. First year males have a grey crown and the back has patches of chestnut and grey. First year females can be difficult to separate from female red-headed buntings although having more streaking on the crown than on the lower back. The vent is yellow.</p><p>The black- and red-headed buntings represent sister species which forms a clade along with the crested bunting.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Habitat_and_distribution\">Habitat and distribution</span></h2>\n<p>The black-headed bunting breeds in open scrubby areas including agricultural land. In winter they move to Asia and large flocks are found in agricultural fields and grasslands. The longest migration noted from a ringed individual is about 7,000\u00a0km. Another ringed bird was determined to have flown 1,000\u00a0km in seven days. Males form pure flocks during migration and arrive in the winter quarters well before the females. The winter range within India is mainly in western and northern India extending south to northern Karnataka. In winter they form large communal roosts in thorny acacia trees, often joining other species such as the yellow-throated sparrow.</p><p>The main breeding zone extends from south-eastern Europe to central Asia. The wintering grounds are mainly in India although vagrants have been found wintering as far east as Japan, China, Hong Kong, Thailand, Laos, South Korea and Malaysia. Summer vagrants may occur as far north in Europe as Norway.\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Behaviour_and_ecology\">Behaviour and ecology</span></h2>\n\n \n<p>The black-headed bunting is found in flocks as it forages on grasslands for seeds. They breed in summer, building a nest in a low bush or on the ground. The nest is a cup made of dry grass and lined with hair. The clutch consists of four to six eggs. The eggs hatch after about 13 days and the chicks fledge after about 10 days. Its natural food consists of insects when feeding young, and otherwise seeds. In Bulgaria, the collapse of the drying cotton thistle (<i>Onopordum acanthium</i>) stems on which the birds build their nests has caused high mortality; this is thought to be an example of an ecological trap. In northern Iran, there is a region of range overlap with the red-headed bunting and natural hybrids are common although molecular data indicates that there is considerable genetic divergence between the two species.</p><p>Like the red-headed bunting but unlike many other <i>Emberiza</i> buntings, it has two moults in a year. It undergoes one moult in the winter quarters prior to migrating back to the breeding region, and another after breeding. Young birds fledge with a soft plumage and then moult into a juvenile plumage before migrating and then assume an adult plumage after moulting in their winter quarters.</p><p>In winter their call is a single note tweet or soft <i>zrit</i>. The song consists of a loud series of strophes each made up a high harsh notes that accelerate into a jangling mix with some clear slurred notes interspersed before stopping abruptly.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Gallery\">Gallery</span></h2>\n<ul class=\"gallery mw-gallery-traditional\"><li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\">\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\">\n</ul><h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n\n<h2><span id=\"External_links\">External links</span></h2>\n<ul><li>Photographs, videos and sound recordings on the Internet Bird Collection</li></ul> "

        "details": " <p class=\"mw-empty-elt\">\n\n</p>\n<p>The <b>black-headed gull </b> (<i>Chroicocephalus ridibundus</i>) is a small gull that breeds in much of  the Palearctic including Europe and also in coastal eastern Canada. Most of the population is migratory and winters further south, but some birds reside in the milder westernmost areas of Europe. Some black-headed gulls also spend the winter in northeastern North America, where it was formerly known as the common black-headed gull. As is the case with many gulls, it was previously placed in the genus <i>Larus</i>.\n</p><p>The genus name <i> Chroicocephalus</i> is from Ancient Greek <i>khroizo</i>, \"to colour\", and <i>kephale</i>, \"head\". The specific <i>ridibundus</i> is Latin for \"laughing\", from <i>ridere</i> \"to laugh\".</p><p>The black-headed gull displays a variety of compelling behaviours and adaptations. Some of these include removing eggshells from ones nest after hatching, begging coordination between siblings, differences between sexes, conspecific brood parasitism, and extra-pair paternity. They are an overwintering species, found in a variety of different habitats.</p>\n\n\n<h2><span id=\"Description\">Description</span></h2>\n<p>This gull is 38\u201344\u00a0cm (15\u201317\u00a0in) long with a 94\u2013105\u00a0cm (37\u201341\u00a0in) wingspan. In flight, the white leading edge to the wing is a good field mark. The summer adult has a chocolate-brown head (not black, although does look black from a distance), pale grey body, black tips to the primary wing feathers, and red bill and legs. The hood is lost in winter, leaving just two dark spots. Immature birds have a mottled pattern of brown spots over most of the body. It breeds in colonies in large reed beds or marshes, or on islands in lakes, nesting on the ground. Like most gulls, it is highly gregarious in winter, both when feeding or in evening roosts. It is not a pelagic species and is rarely seen at sea far from coasts.\n</p><p>The black-headed gull is a bold and opportunistic feeder. It eats insects, fish, seeds, worms, scraps, and carrion in towns, or invertebrates in ploughed fields with equal relish. It is a noisy species, especially in colonies, with a familiar \"kree-ar\" call. Its scientific name means <i>laughing gull</i>.\n</p><p>This species takes two years to reach maturity. First-year birds have a black terminal tail band, more dark areas in the wings, and, in summer, a less fully developed dark hood. Like most gulls, black-headed gulls are long-lived birds, with a maximum age of at least 32.9 years recorded in the wild, in addition to an anecdote now believed of dubious authenticity regarding a 63-year-old bird.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Distribution\">Distribution</span></h2>\n<p>To be found over much of Europe, except Spain, Italy and Greece. It is also found in across the Palearctic to Japan and E China. It is an occasional visitor to the east coast of North America.\n</p><p>And also in some Caribbean islands.\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Behaviour\">Behaviour</span></h2>\n<h3><span id=\"Eggshell_removal\">Eggshell removal</span></h3>\n<p>Eggshell removal is a behaviour seen in birds once the chicks have hatched, observed mostly to reduce risk of predation. Removing the eggshell acts as a way of camouflage to avoid predators seeing the nest. The further away egg shells are from the nest, the lower the predation risk. Black-headed gull eggs experience predation from different species of birds, foxes, stoats, and even other black-headed gulls. Although mothers show some form of aggressiveness when a predator is near, in the first 30 minutes, wet chicks can be easily taken by other black-headed gulls after hatching when the parents of the wet chick are distracted.</p><p>Black headed gulls also carry away other objects that do not belong in the nest. The removal of eggshells and other objects is important not only in the incubation period but also during the first few days after the eggs hatch. However, the removal process seems to increase as time goes on. The removal is done by both the male and female parents, normally lasts a few seconds and is done three times a year.</p><p>A black-headed gull is able to differentiate an egg shell from an egg by acknowledging its thin, serrated, white, edge. Therefore, the weight of the egg or eggshell does not play a role when determining its value.</p>\n<h4><span id=\"Earlier_eggshell_removal_hypotheses\">Earlier eggshell removal hypotheses</span></h4>\n<p>Other hypotheses have attempted to explain the survival value of black-headed gulls removing their eggshells from the nest, including:</p>\n<ol><li>The sharp edges of the shells after hatching could harm the chicks</li>\n<li>The eggshell could somehow intrude during the brooding</li>\n<li>The eggshell could slip over the unhatched egg, creating a double shell</li>\n<li>Some of the moist organic material left from the shell could lead to a production of bacteria and mould</li></ol><h3><span id=\"Breeding\">Breeding</span></h3>\n<h4><span id=\"Begging_coordination_between_siblings\">Begging coordination between siblings</span></h4>\n<p>Black-headed gulls feed their young by regurgitating it onto the ground, rather than into each chick one at a time. The parents tend to accommodate their regurgitation amounts for how intense the nest begging is, from both an individual chick or a group of chicks begging together. Chicks who are siblings, have learned this behaviour and begin synchronizing their begging signals to decrease the costs as an individual and increase the benefits as a whole. The rate of parental food regurgitation to chicks increases with begging intensity.</p><p>The amount and response of begging signals differs throughout the nestling period. Usually, there is 3-5 begging events/hour, each lasting around one minute. High intensity begging behaviour appears at the end of the first week in the nest, but the coordination between multiple chicks emerge during the last week of the nestling period. The more siblings present, the more they coordinate their begging while decreasing the number of begging.</p>\n<h4><span id=\"Sex_differences\">Sex differences</span></h4>\n<p>Male chicks have less of a chance of survival when compared to female chicks. Black-headed gulls are a sexually size-dimorphic species, so the larger sex is at a disadvantage when the amount of food sources are low.</p><p>Male birds are more likely to be born in the first egg and female birds are more likely to be born in the third. The position of a female black-headed gull in response to the food available when laying the eggs can predict the offsprings characteristics.</p>\n<h4><span id=\"Conspecific_brood_parasitism\">Conspecific brood parasitism</span></h4>\n<p>Conspecific brood parasitism is a behaviour that occurs when females lay their eggs in another females nest, of the same species. It can reduce the cost of incubation and nestling young by passing it on to another bird. Black-headed gulls usually lay three egg clutches, and the first two are normally larger than the third. The third egg normally has the lowest survival rate, while the first or second are usually the parasitic eggs.</p><p>Most of the egg dumping occurs within the beginning of the egg laying period. The parasitic eggs being laid in another conspecifics nest increases the chance of hatching and may occur because of nest desertion or a nest being taken over by another bird.</p><p>Multiple eggs in a nest from different mothers may also result from intra-specific nest parasitism, joint female nesting, and nest takeover. Intra-specific nest parasitism is a disadvantage to the hosts because the female could end up taking care of the parasitic chicks over her own and therefore neglecting them and reducing their fitness. Another disadvantage for the host is that incubating more chicks than their own takes up more energy.</p>\n<h4><span id=\"Extra-pair_paternity\">Extra-pair paternity</span></h4>\n<p>The rate of extra-pair paternity (EPP) has a large variation between populations of black-headed gulls. It is primarily a context-dependent strategy, meaning not all black headed gulls experience this behaviour. The variation between populations of extra-pair paternity can be explained by the variation it has on the advantages and disadvantages it has on a female, as well, as the variation in pressure on a females choice.</p><p>The differences in the rate of EPP may be determined by multiple different factors: life history traits, ecological factors or different behavioural strategies of males.</p>\n<h4><span id=\"Central.E2.80.93periphery_gradient_within_colonies\"></span><span id=\"Central\u2013periphery_gradient_within_colonies\">Central\u2013periphery gradient within colonies</span></h4>\n<p>Egg-laying can be earlier in Black-headed Gulls nesting in the centre of the colony, with central pairs tending to lay larger eggs, which have a higher hatching success, than pairs nesting at the periphery of the colony. Centrally nesting individuals have also been found to be in better condition and have higher genetic quality.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Walking_displays\">Walking displays</span></h3>\n<p>Black-headed gulls display both head-bobbing walking (HBW) and non-bobbing walking (NBW). Head-bobbing walking is expressed by a hold phase and a thrust phase. The hold phase in black-headed gulls occurs mainly during the single support phase and is when the bird balances its head to equal the environment. Head-bobbing walking occurs during a seeking type foraging by walking through water and includes benefits such as enhancing motion and pattern detection and gathering depth information from motion parallax during the thrust phase. Non-bobbing walking occurs when black-headed gulls are displaying a waiting behaviour while foraging on flat surfaces.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Uses\">Uses</span></h2>\n\n<p>The eggs of the black-headed gull are considered a delicacy by some in the UK and are eaten hard boiled.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Synchronization\">Synchronization</span></h2>\n<p>Observations on the behavior of black-headed gulls show that black-headed gulls individuals synchronize their activity with other black-headed gulls neighbors. Synchronization in black-headed gulls groups is dependent on the distance between the black-headed gulls members.</p><p><br></p>\n<h2><span id=\"Gallery\">Gallery</span></h2>\n<ul class=\"gallery mw-gallery-traditional\"><li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\">\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\">\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\">\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\">\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\">\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\">\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\">\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\">\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\">\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\">\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\">\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\">\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\">\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\">\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\">\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\">\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\">\n</ul><h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n\n<h2><span id=\"External_links\">External links</span></h2>\n<ul><li>Black-headed gull stamps from many countries at bird-stamps.org</li>\n<li>Ageing and sexing (PDF; 2.0 MB) by Javier Blasco-Zumeta &amp; Gerd-Michael Heinze</li>\n<li>Feathers of Black-headed Gull (Larus ridibundus) at Ornithos.de</li>\n<li>BirdLife species factsheet for <i>Larus ridibundus</i></li>\n<li><cite class=\"citation web\">\"Chroicocephalus ridibundus\". <i>Avibase</i>.</cite><span title=\"ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rft.genre=unknown&amp;rft.jtitle=Avibase&amp;rft.atitle=Chroicocephalus+ridibundus&amp;rft_id=https%3A%2F%2Favibase.bsc-eoc.org%2Fspecies.jsp%3Flang%3DEN%26avibaseid%3DFB02DD9658CC1EC6&amp;rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fen.wikipedia.org%3ABlack-headed+gull\"></span><link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r951705291\"> </li>\n<li><cite class=\"citation web\">\"Common black-headed gull media\". <i>Internet Bird Collection</i>.</cite><span title=\"ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rft.genre=unknown&amp;rft.jtitle=Internet+Bird+Collection&amp;rft.atitle=Common+black-headed+gull+media&amp;rft_id=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.hbw.com%2Fibc%2Fspecies%2Fcommon-black-headed-gull-larus-ridibundus&amp;rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fen.wikipedia.org%3ABlack-headed+gull\"></span><link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r951705291\"></li>\n<li>Black-headed gull photo gallery at VIREO (Drexel University)</li>\n<li>Interactive range map of <i>Larus ridibundus</i> at IUCN Red List maps</li>\n<li>Audio recordings of Black-headed gull on Xeno-canto.</li>\n<li><i>Chroicocephalus ridibundus</i> in the Flickr: Field Guide Birds of the World</li>\n<li>Black-headed gull media from ARKive </li></ul>"

It is the only native ibis species in its range that has an overall white plumage with a black neck and head. The down-curved beak and legs are also black. Though often referred to as a wetland species, the black-headed ibis forages in a range of natural and man-made habitats. This species of ibis nests only during the rainy season (or monsoon).\n</p>\n\n\n<h2><span id=\"Description\">Description</span></h2>\n<p>The black-headed ibis is one of several large waterbird species in south and south-east Asia, with adults measuring 65\u201376\u00a0cm in length. The white plumage is starkly contrasted against a conspicuous naked black neck and head, and black down-curved beak. Tails of adults bear light grey ornamental feathers that turn jet black during the breeding season. During the breeding season, bare patches under the wing turn blood-red. The head of some breeding adults gain a blueish tinge, or very rarely have a pink or bright red patch behind the neck. Some breeding adults also develop tufts of white feathers behind the neck, and rarely also get a yellowish colouration on the breast and back. Sexes are identical but juveniles are identifiable from adults in having greyish feathering on the neck and speckled brown-grey feathering on the wings and back. Like storks and spoonbills, it lacks a true voice-producing mechanism and is silent except for ventriloquistic grunts uttered by pairs at the nest.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Distribution_range_and_habitat\">Distribution range and habitat</span></h2>\n<p>Black-headed ibis are native to the following countries: Bangladesh, Cambodia, China, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, Philippines, Russian Federation, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Viet Nam. They are migratory or vagrant in Japan, Republic of Korea, Lao People's Democratic Republic and Mongolia. The species is a widespread breeding bird in India, Sri Lanka, Nepal and Myanmar, and has declined considerably to few locations or breeding colonies in Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Viet Nam. The most rapid decline in recent times is suspected to be the population in Sumatra.</p><p>The black-headed ibis is very versatile being able to use a large variety of natural and man-made habitats. These include freshwater and salt-water marshes, lakes and ponds, as also rice fields, freshly ploughed crop fields, irrigation canals, riversides, reservoirs, urban lakes, open sewage gutters, grazing lots, and garbage dumping sites. Ibis alter use of varied preferred foraging habitats by season in agricultural landscapes such as in south-western Uttar Pradesh in India. In summer, they largely use and prefer natural marshes and fallow fields, but in the monsoon, spread out more evenly to also use a variety of agricultural fields. In landscapes that have more forests and rocky hills as in southern Rajasthan, wetlands are the preferred habitats year-round. Open sewage lines are used more during the dry summers, and ibis increase the use of grazing lands during the monsoon.\n</p><p>It nests in heronry colonies near wetlands. It builds a platform nest of sticks, lined with grass and threads. </p>\n<h2><span id=\"Gallery\">Gallery</span></h2>\n\n<ul class=\"gallery mw-gallery-traditional\"><li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 200px\">\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 200px\">\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 200px\">\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 200px\">\n</ul><h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n\n<h2><span id=\"Further_reading\">Further reading</span></h2>\n<ul><li>Grimmett, Inskipp and Inskipp; <i>Birds of India</i>. <link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r951705291\">ISBN\u00a00-691-04910-6</li></ul> "

Linnaeus was confused by the similar appearance of the unrelated New World orioles and the Old World orioles. In his entry for <i>Coracias xanthornus</i> he cited a descriptions of birds occurring in Jamaica by Mark Catesby and Patrick Browne as well as an illustration by George Edwards of a bird occurring in Bengal. Linnaeus specified the habitat as \"America\" but Bengal is now the recognised type location. Also in the 10th edition Linnaeus listed <i>Sturnus luteolus</i> among the starlings and cited another illustration by Edwards. He renamed this species as <i>Oriolus melanocephalus</i> in the  12th edition of 1766.

Neither the plate caption nor Buffon's description included a scientific name but in 1783 the Dutch naturalist Pieter Boddaert coined the binomial name <i>Muscicapa azurea</i> in his catalogue of the <i>Planches Enlumin\u00e9es</i>. Buffon specified that his specimen had been collected in the Philippines, but in 1939 the American ornithologist James L. Peters restricted the type locality to Manila on the island of Luzon. The black-naped monarch is now placed in the genus <i>Hypothymis</i> was introduced by the German zoologist Friedrich Boie in 1826 with the black-naped monarch as the type species. The genus name is from the Ancient Greek <i>hupothumis</i>, the name of an unidentified bird mentioned by the playwright Aristophanes.

However, several geographically separated breeding populations differ in the extent and shade of markings. The Indian peninsula  has subspecies <i>H. a. styani</i> (which subsumes <i>H. a. sykesi</i> of Stuart Baker), in which males have very distinct black markings and a whitish abdomen. Males of the Sri Lankan race <i>H. a. ceylonensis</i> lack the black nape and gorget and the shade is more purplish.

It is insectivorous, often hunting by flycatching. When alarmed or alert, the nape feathers are raised into a pointed crest. They join mixed-species foraging flocks, being among the most significant members of such flocks in the Western Ghats, and are active in the understory of forest canopies. A study in Sri Lanka showed that they are affected by human disturbance causing them to recede from disturbed edges by about 75 m.</p><p>Although they are largely residents, local seasonal movements are known. The breeding season in India is March to August and the nest is a neat cup placed in a fork. The cup is lined with filaments of webbing and fungi including those of the genus <i>Marasmius</i> which are known to produce antibiotics and may benefit the birds by protecting the young from infection. The nest is built by the female while the male guards. The typical clutch is three eggs, which both parents incubate and both feed the young, which hatch after about 12 days.</p><p>The webs of large spiders such as <i>Nephila maculata</i> have been known to trap the bird. An astrovirus was detected in a black-naped monarch in Cambodia, a virus that was earlier unknown from passerines.

Although Brisson coined Latin names, these do not conform to the binomial system and are not recognised by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature. When in 1766 the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his <i>Systema Naturae</i> for the twelfth edition, he added 240 species that had been previously described by Brisson. One of these was the black-naped oriole. Linnaeus included a brief description, coined the current binomial name <i>Oriolus chinensis</i> and cited Brisson's work.

It has been suggested that they may have aided in the dispersal of <i>Ficus</i> species into the island of Krakatoa where they were also among the early pioneer species. In India it has been noted to take nectar from large flowers such as those of <i>Salmalia</i> and <i>Erythrina</i>. They can sometimes be nest predators on smaller birds. The breeding season is April to June (January\u2013March in the Nicobars) and the nest is a deep cup in a fork of a tree. The eggs, two to three, are salmon pink with reddish spots and darker blotches The nests are often built in the vicinity of the nest of a black drongo. Two or three nests may be built by the female and one is finally chosen for laying eggs. Males may sometimes sit beside the unused nests. Incubation is by the female alone and the eggs hatch after 14 to 16 days and the chicks fledge after another two weeks. Females stay closer to the nest, taking part in nest sanitation by removal of fecal sacs, driving away predators and feeding the young. The males take a more active role in feeding and guarding. Eurasian tree sparrows and black bulbuls may sometimes use abandoned nests. Nest predators include crows, treepies and hawks. In many parts of Southeast Asia, they are trapped and sold in the bird trade.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n\n<h2><span id=\"External_links\">External links</span></h2>\n<ul><li>Pictures and media</li>\n<li>Peregrine falcon preying on black-naped oriole</li></ul>"

The specific epithet <i>canus</i> is the Latin for \"grey\".</p><p>Eleven subspecies are recognised.</p>\n<ul><li><i>P. c. canus</i> Gmelin, JF, 1788 \u2013 north and central Europe to west Siberia</li>\n<li><i>P. c. jessoensis</i> Stejneger, 1886 \u2013 east Siberia to northeast China, Korea and north Japan (includes <i>griseoviridis</i>)</li>\n<li><i>P. c. kogo</i> (Bianchi, 1906) \u2013 central China</li>\n<li><i>P. c. guerini</i> (Malherbe, 1849) \u2013 north central and east central China</li>\n<li><i>P. c. sobrinus</i> Peters, JL, 1948 \u2013 southeast China and northeast Vietnam</li>\n<li><i>P. c. tancolo</i> (Gould, 1863) \u2013 Hainan Island (off southeast China) and Taiwan</li>\n<li><i>P. c. sordidior</i> (Rippon, 1906) \u2013 southeast Tibet and southwest China to northeast Myanmar</li>\n<li><i>P. c. sanguiniceps</i> Baker, ECS, 1926 \u2013 northeast Pakistan to north India and west Nepal</li>\n<li><i>P. c. hessei</i> Gyldenstolpe, 1916 \u2013 Nepal and northeast India to Myanmar and Indochina</li>\n<li><i>P. c. robinsoni</i> (Ogilvie-Grant, 1906) \u2013 west Malaysia</li>\n<li><i>P. c. dedemi</i> (van Oort, 1911) \u2013 Sumatra</li></ul><p>The subspecies <i>P. c. guerini</i> and <i>P. c. dedemi</i> are sometimes recognised as separate species, the black-naped woodpecker and the Sumatran woodpecker.</p><p>There is evidence for hybridisation between grey-headed and European green woodpeckers. However, these seem extremely rare. It appears that the female partner was invariably a grey-headed woodpecker. Nothing has been reported concerning the fertility of such hybrid offspring. Their plumage resembles a grey-headed woodpecker more closely, but with a red parting on the head, a reddish nape and a brighter iris, while some were conspicuous for their dark coloration.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Description\">Description</span></h2>\n\n<p>The grey-headed woodpecker is 25\u201326\u00a0cm (9.8\u201310.2\u00a0in) in length, has a wingspan of 38\u201340\u00a0cm (15\u201316\u00a0in) and weighs around 125\u00a0g (4.4\u00a0oz). The male of the nominate subspecies has a grey head with a red forecrown. There is a black line across the lores and a narrow black moustache stripe. The back, <dfn id=\"\"><span title=\"See entry at: Glossary of bird terms \u00a7\u2006scapulars\">scapulars</span></dfn> and wing <dfn id=\"\"><span title=\"See entry at: Glossary of bird terms \u00a7\u2006coverts\">coverts</span></dfn> are green. The breast and underbody are pale grey. The folded primaries are barred brown-black on grey-white. The female lacks the red forecrown but has fine black streaks on the crown. The widely distributed <i>Picus canus jessoensis</i> is very similar to the nominate subspecies but is slightly greyer and less green. The Chinese subspecies <i>Picus canus guerini</i> has a black nape patch and a greenish underbody. The subspecies <i>Picus canus hessei</i> is similar to <i>guerini</i> but is more golden green above and a deeper green below. The race on the island of Sumatra, <i>Picus canus dedemi</i>, differs markedly from the other subspecies in having reddish rather than green above, and red, green and grey below. It has a black crown and nape. Specimens of the more widespread of the two Eastern subspecies, <i>P. c. jessoensis</i>, are usually a little larger and heavier than individuals from the type locality. On average, it is somewhat smaller and lighter than the European green woodpecker. In the field, this distinction in size is difficult to make. Its size is approximately that of a Eurasian collared dove.\n</p><p>Grey-headed woodpeckers have uniformly olive green upperparts, transitioning across the neck to a light grey, the head being that latter colour. The typical woodpecker markings are small and not particularly conspicuous. It has a grey head with black moustache, and the male has a red crown. It has a shorter neck, slimmer bill and slightly rounder head than the green woodpecker.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Sounds\">Sounds</span></h3>\n<p>Calls made by the European green woodpecker and grey-headed woodpecker resemble each other. The far-carrying territorial song of the grey-headed woodpecker is more melodic and cleaner than the explosive \"laughter\" of the green woodpecker. The call series consists of ten to fifteen utterances of declining pitch and gradual slowing. The verse may appear melancholic and \"dying\". The territorial song of females is similar, but somewhat quieter, less melodious, but more croaky and often shorter.</p><p>Besides these partner-specific vocalisations, aggressive noises can be heard from both sexes, but more often the male. Typical are individual, sharp <i>kuek</i> sounds that may, with increasing irritation, be placed in sequence and be continued as <i>kek</i>. A single <i>kuek</i> may also be a predator warning, as begging nestlings will immediately fall silent if this call is made by either parent. Individual drumming activity by grey-headed woodpeckers can be quite varied, but they drum on more occasions than European green woodpeckers. Drumming frequence can be 20 Hertz, with a \"drum roll\" lasting up to 40 beats, or two seconds. Both sexes drum, but the female less often than the male, and usually more quietly and shorter. Grey-headed woodpeckers often continue to use the same well-resonating drum sites for years \u2013 these can even be at a considerable distance from the nest. Grey-headed woodpeckers often use metal covers on masts and roofs as drumming substrate due to their favourable resonance characteristics.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Distribution_and_habitat\">Distribution and habitat</span></h2>\n<p>The grey-headed woodpecker is found in wide parts of Central, Northern and Eastern Europe, as well as a wide belt south of the boreal coniferous forests across Asia all the way to the Pacific coast, Sakhalin and Hokkaid\u014d. Its northern limit is at the border between closed coniferous and mixed forest; the southern limit is where tree steppe transitions to treeless shrubby steppe. In East Asia, the species is most differentiated, and south of Manchuria covers the Korean Peninsula, as well as large parts of eastern China and Farther India, the mountain forests of the Malay Peninsula.</p><p>In Europe, the type subspecies breeds within a wide belt from western France to the Urals. It has settled medium latitudes of Scandinavia as well as Central, Eastern and Southern Europe. There is contradictory information regarding its occurrence in Turkey. Most likely, several hundred pairs breed in Mittelgebirge habitats of the Pontic Mountains. The species is absent from the North German Plain, British Isles, Iberian Peninsula, and Mediterranean islands. In Italy, it is confined to the northernmost parts.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Behaviour_and_ecology\">Behaviour and ecology</span></h2>\n<h3><span id=\"Breeding\">Breeding</span></h3>\n<p>Grey-headed woodpeckers breed in May and lay five to ten eggs which are brought up by both parents. The young hatch after 15\u201317 days, and fledge in 24\u201325 days.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Food_and_feeding\">Food and feeding</span></h3>\n\n<p>The grey-headed woodpecker is a somewhat less specialised ant hunter than the European green woodpecker. In its foraging strategy it is intermediate between many <i>Dendrocopos</i> species on the one hand, and the often ant-specific members of the genus <i>Picus</i>. This reduced ant specialisation of the grey-headed woodpecker allows it to be sympatric with European green woodpeckers and even to breed at about 100 meters from them.</p><p>Nonetheless, ants and their immatures make up the lion's share of the grey-headed woodpecker's diet, particularly in spring and summer. Wood ants of the genus <i>Formica</i> as well as members of <i>Lasius</i> and Myrmicinae such as <i>Myrmica</i> spp. predominate, and with termites may make up 90% of the diet. Besides those, caterpillars, crickets, bark and wood beetle larvae, flies, spiders and lice are part of the diet. In late autumn and early winter, grey-headed woodpeckers switch to including significant amounts of vegetable matter, such as berries and other fruits, in their diets on a regular basis.</p>\n\n<h2><span id=\"Conservation_status\">Conservation status</span></h2>\n<p>The grey-headed woodpecker is difficult to record, as isolated breeding pairs don't often call. These are therefore easily overlooked, and population records have corresponding gaps. It is probable that European populations, especially at the north-western margin of the range, have receded in numbers and distribution. Since the 1990s, populations seem to be recovering as a result of mild winters. Globally, there is a slight reduction in population numbers, but insufficiently so for an elevated threat status. The species is therefore considered safe.</p><p>The observation of stable or slightly increasing populations in Europe may, however, be based solely on greater effort in recording the species. The overall European population is estimated at 180,000 to 320,000 breeding pairs. Key populations are found in European parts of Russia as well as Romania. Germany has around 15,000 pairs, Austria approximately 2,500 and Switzerland some 1,500. There are no summary figures for populations outside Europe.\n</p><p>As the grey-headed woodpecker prefers undisturbed and ancient forests with natural cohort structure as well as riparian forests for breeding, the destruction of such habitat is the greatest threat to the species.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n\n<ul><li>Gorman, Gerard (2004): Woodpeckers of Europe: A Study of the European Picidae.

It is 139\u00a0cm (55\u00a0in) long with a 235\u00a0cm (7.8\u00a0ft) wingspan, and it weighs 5.5\u00a0kg (12\u00a0lbs). It is whitish-gray, with a black head, red crown patch, black upper neck and legs, and white patch to the rear of the eye. It has black primaries and secondaries. Both sexes are similar. Some populations are known to make seasonal movements. It is revered in Buddhist traditions and culturally protected across much of its range. A festival in Bhutan celebrates the bird while the Indian union territory of Jammu and Kashmir considers it as the state bird.\n</p>\n\n\n<h2><span id=\"Description\">Description</span></h2>\n<p>This medium-sized crane is mostly grey with a black head and neck. The lores and crown are naked and dull red. A small patch of white feathers are present below and behind the eye. The tail is black and makes it easy to distinguish at a distance from the similar looking common crane which has grey tail.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Distribution_and_habitat\">Distribution and habitat</span></h2>\n\n\n<p>The black-necked crane summers mainly in the high altitude Tibetan Plateau. The breeding areas are alpine meadows, lakeside and riverine marshes and river valleys. They also make use of barley and wheat fields in these areas. Wintering areas tend to be in sheltered valleys or lower altitudes. The largest populations are in China with smaller numbers extending into Vietnam, Bhutan and India. Small populations have been noted in northern Sikkim. A small group of 20 to 40 was once known to regularly visit the Subansiri area in the Apa Tani valley until 1975 and vagrants have been recorded in Nepal.</p><p>In 1996 there were about 4,000 of the birds, most of whom spent their winters in Tibet in the valleys of the Nyanga, Lhasa and Pengbo rivers and the middle reaches of the Yarlung Tsangpo.\nThe Hutoushan Reservoir in the Pengbo valley is an important winter resting place, with a 96 square kilometres (37 sq mi) Linzhou Black-necked Crane Preservation Zone established in 1993.\nBlack-necked cranes also winter in small numbers in two valleys of western Arunachal Pradesh, India. These are Sangti and Zemithang.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Behaviour_and_ecology\">Behaviour and ecology</span></h2><p>\nBlack-necked cranes forage on the ground in small groups, often with one bird acting as a sentinel. In winter, the groups arrive and leave the feeding grounds together, but may split into family groups, each group keeping their own small feeding territories in a big marshes or fields. They spend nearly 75% of the day foraging with peak feeding in the early morning and late afternoon. While foraging, they keep walking and they also walk long distances between the feeding spots. In this manner, they cover several kilometers a day while foraging. They feed on the tubers of sedges, plant roots, earthworms, insects and other invertebrates, frogs and other small vertebrates. They may also feed on fallen grains of barley, oats and buckwheat and will sometimes dig up and feed on potatoes, carrots and turnips. Their loud trumpeting calls are similar to those of other cranes.</p><p>\nThese birds are very wary, but in some areas they are accustomed to the local people who do not disturb them. These cranes appear to be able to distinguish people in traditional dress and are especially wary of others.</p><p>Like many other crane species, they are believed to form long-lasting pair bonds and dancing displays are made during the breeding season. The breeding birds are territorial and will chase away any intruders of the same species immediately, though they are generally tolerant of other species. The nest site is usually a pre-existing mud island inside a large shallow wetland, sometimes shared along with bar-headed goose. The nest varies from a scantily lined scratch in the ground to a structure made of grass, rushes and weeds with a depression in the centre, sometimes the eggs laid directly on the grass without any structure. Eggs are laid mainly in May and June. One or two eggs. The birds are relatively more wary when the young ones are small. Till the time when the young ones are able to fly, the family kept moving around the nesting location, but later the family started traveling far and wide in the course of a day. Though the young ones are able to forage independently, usually they accompany the parents during foraging. Short, subdued nasal \"kurrr\" calls are used by the family to keep in contact and also by adults to indicate availability of food to juveniles. The adults were found to feed the young ones mainly with fish in Ladakh, adults fishing like herons. They are endangered because of the hunters.\n</p><h2><span id=\"Status_and_threats\">Status and threats</span></h2>\n\n<p>The estimated population of the black-necked crane is between 8800 and 11000 individuals. These birds are legally protected in China, India and Bhutan. However habitat modification, drying of lakes and agriculture are threats to the populations. In many areas, dogs belonging to herders are a major threat to young birds. An incident of leopards preying on the roosting cranes during the night has been recorded from the Phobjika valley of Bhutan. In Bhutan Collisions with power lines has been another cause of mortality in some areas. Eggs may also be preyed on by ravens that may use the opportunity provided when humans disturb the parents. The drying of wetlands can cause increased accessibility of the nests leading to predation while a rise in the water level can submerge nests. Loss and degradation of habitat are the main threats facing the black-necked cranes. The problems are most serious in the wintering areas, where wetlands are extensively affected by human activity including irrigation, dam construction, draining, and grazing pressure. In Tibet, widespread changes in traditional agricultural practices have reduced the availability of waste barley and spring wheat.</p><p>Populations in Bhutan are well protected both culturally and legally although some disturbance from tourism exists.</p><p>The black-necked crane is evaluated as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.

It was described in 1831 by Christian Ludwig Brehm. There are currently three accepted subspecies, including the nominate subspecies. Its breeding plumage features a distinctive ochre-coloured plumage which extends behind its eye and over its ear coverts. The rest of the upper parts, including the head, neck, and breast, are coloured black to blackish brown. The flanks are tawny rufous to maroon-chestnut, and the abdomen is white. When in its non-breeding plumage, this bird has greyish-black upper parts, including the top of the head and a vertical stripe on the back of the neck. The flanks are also greyish-black. The rest of the body is a white or whitish colour. The juvenile has more brown in its darker areas. The subspecies <i>californicus</i> can be distinguished from the nominate by the former's usually longer bill. The other subspecies, <i>P. n. gurneyi</i>, can be differentiated by its greyer head and upper parts and by its smaller size. <i>P. n. gurneyi</i> can also be told apart by its lack of a non-breeding plumage. This species is present in parts of Africa, Eurasia, and the Americas.\n</p><p>The black-necked grebe uses multiple foraging techniques. Insects, which make up the majority of this bird's diet, are caught either on the surface of the water or when they are in flight. It occasionally practices foliage gleaning. This grebe dives to catch crustaceans, molluscs, tadpoles, and small frogs and fish. When moulting at saline lakes, this bird feeds mostly on brine shrimp. The black-necked grebe makes a floating cup nest on an open lake. The nest cup is covered with a disc. This nest is located both in colonies and by itself. During the breeding season, which varies depending on location, this species will lay one (sometimes two) clutch of three to four eggs. The number of eggs is sometimes larger due to conspecific brood parasitism. After a 21-day incubation period, the eggs hatch, and then the nest is deserted. After about 10 days, the parents split up the chicks between themselves. After this, the chicks become independent in about 10 days, and fledge in about three weeks.\n</p><p>Although it generally avoids flight, the black-necked grebe travels as far as 6,000 kilometres (3,700\u00a0mi) during migration. In addition, it becomes flightless for two months after completing a migration to reach an area where it can safely moult. During this moult, the grebe can double in weight. The migrations to reach these areas are dangerous, sometimes with thousands of grebe deaths. In spite of this, it is classified as a least concern species by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN). It is likely that this is the most numerous grebe in the world. There are potential threats to it, such as oil spills, but these are not likely to present a major risk to the overall population.\n</p>\n\n\n<h2><span id=\"Taxonomy\">Taxonomy</span></h2>\n<p>This species was first described by Carl Ludwig Hablitz in 1783 as <i>Colymbus caspicus</i>, from a bird in Bandar-e Anzali. This was originally thought to be a synonym for the horned grebe, until Erwin Stresemann discovered that the description applied more to the black-necked grebe in 1948. Before this, the earliest description was thought to be by Christian Ludwig Brehm in 1831, who gave this bird its current scientific name of <i>Podiceps nigricollis</i> from a German bird. To resolve this, the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature suppressed the name <i>C. caspicus</i>. The genus name <i>Dytes</i> is sometimes used for this species, a placement which was formalized by Robert Ridgway in 1881.</p><p>This bird is closely related to the silvery grebe and the Junin grebe. The extinct Colombian grebe is sometimes considered to be a subspecies of this species, in addition to three other extant subspecies:</p>\n<ul><li><i>P. n. nigricollis</i> \u2013 <small>(Brehm, CL, 1831)</small>: nominate, is found from western Europe to western temperate Asia (wintering to the south and west), in central and eastern Asia, and in eastern Africa</li>\n<li><i>P. n. gurneyi</i> \u2013 <small>(Roberts, 1919)</small>: is found in southern Africa</li>\n<li><i>P. n. californicus</i> \u2013 <small>(Heermann, 1854)</small>: is found from southwestern Canada through the western U.S. It winters as far south as Guatemala</li></ul><p>The generic name, <i>Podiceps</i>, comes from two Latin words: <i>podicis</i>, meaning \"vent\" or \"anus\" and <i>pes</i> meaning \"foot\". This is a reference to the attachment point of the bird's legs\u2014at the extreme back end of its body. The specific epithet <i>nigricollis</i> is Latin for \"black-necked\": <i>niger</i> means \"black\" and <i>collis</i> means \"neck\". The subspecies epithet <i>californicus</i> comes from \"California\", while <i>gurneyi</i> comes from the name of British ornithologist John Henry Gurney Sr.</p><p>\"Black-necked grebe\" has been designated the official name by the International Ornithological Committee (IOC). Both common names for this species refer to features visible when the bird is in its breeding plumage; in such plumage, it has an all-black neck and a spray of golden plumes on each side of its head. The name \"eared grebe\" is nearly a century older than the name \"black-necked grebe\". The latter was first used in 1912 by Ernst Hartert, in an effort to bring the common name of the species in line with its scientific name. The name \"eared grebe\" is still used in North America to refer to this bird.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Description\">Description</span></h2>\n\n<p>The black-necked grebe usually measures between 28 and 34 centimetres (11 and 13\u00a0in) in length and weighs 265 to 450 grams (9.3 to 15.9\u00a0oz). The nominate subspecies in breeding plumage has the head, neck, breast, and upper parts coloured black to blackish brown, with the exception of the ochre-coloured fan of feathers extending behind the eye over the eye-coverts and sides of the nape. This eye is mostly red, with a narrow and paler yellow ring on the inner parts of the eye and an orange-yellow to pinkish-red <dfn id=\"\"><span title=\"See entry at: Glossary of bird terms \u00a7\u2006orbital ring\">orbital ring</span></dfn>. The thin, upturned bill, on the other hand, is black, and is connected to the eye by a blackish line starting at the <dfn id=\"\"><span title=\"See entry at: Glossary of bird terms \u00a7\u2006gape\">gape</span></dfn>. Sometimes, the foreneck can be found to be mostly tinged brown. The <dfn id=\"\"><span title=\"See entry at: Glossary of bird terms \u00a7\u2006upperwing\">upperwing</span></dfn> is blackish to drab brown in colour and has a white patch formed by the secondaries and part of the inner primaries. The flanks are coloured tawny rufous to maroon-chestnut and have the occasional blackish fleck. The <dfn id=\"\"><span title=\"See entry at: Glossary of bird terms \u00a7\u2006underwing\">underwing</span></dfn> and abdomen is white, with an exception to the former being the dark tertials and the mostly pale grey-brown outer primaries. The legs are a dark greenish grey. The sexes are similar.</p><p>In non-breeding plumage, the nominate has greyish-black upper parts, cap, nape, and hindneck, with the colour on the upper portion of the latter being contained in a vertical stripe. The dark colour of the cap reaches below the eye and can be seen, diffused, to the ear-coverts. Behind the ear-coverts on the sides of the neck, there are white ovals. The rest of the neck is grey to brownish-grey in colour and has white that varies in amount. The breast is white, and the abdomen is whitish. The flanks are coloured in a mix of blackish-grey with white flecks. The colour of the bill when not breeding differs from that of the breeding plumage, with the former being significantly more grey.</p>\n\n<p>The juvenile black-necked grebe is similar to the non-breeding adult. There are differences, however, including the fact that the dark areas are usually more brownish in the juvenile, with less black. The <dfn id=\"\"><span title=\"See entry at: Glossary of bird terms \u00a7\u2006lores\">lores</span></dfn> are often tinged pale grey, with whitish marks behind the eye. On the sides of the head and upper neck, there is a buffy or tawny tinge. The chick is downy and has a blackish-grey head with stripes and spots that are white or pale buff-grey. The throat and foreneck are largely pale. The upper parts are mostly dark grey in colour, and the abdomen is white.</p><p>The subspecies <i>californicus</i> usually has a longer bill compared to the nominate, and has brown-grey inner primaries during the breeding season. When not breeding, the nominate has diffuse and pale lores less often than <i>Podiceps nigricollis californicus</i>. The other subspecies, <i>P. n. gurneyi</i>, is the smallest of the three subspecies, in addition to having a greyer head and upper parts. The adult of this subspecies also has a rufous-brown tinge on its lesser wing-coverts. It also lacks a non-breeding plumage, in addition to the tufts on the side of its head being paler.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Vocalizations\">Vocalizations</span></h3>\n<p>When breeding, the black-necked grebe gives a quiet \"ooeek\" that ascends in pitch from an already high pitch. This call is also used as a territorial call, in addition to a low and fast trill, which itself is also used during courtship. Another call is a short \"puuii\" or \"wit\". This grebe is silent when it is not the breeding season and when it is feeding or resting.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Distribution_and_habitat\">Distribution and habitat</span></h2>\n<p>This species breeds in vegetated areas of freshwater lakes across Europe, Asia, Africa, northern South America and the southwest and western United States. After breeding, this bird migrates to saline lakes to moult. Then, after completing the moult and waiting for sometimes several months, it migrates to winter in places such as the south-western Palearctic and the eastern parts of both Africa and Asia. It also winters in southern Africa, another place where it breeds. In the Americas, it winters as far south as Guatemala, although the wintering population there is mainly restricted to islands in the Gulf of California, the Salton Sea, and Baja California. When not breeding, its habitat is primarily saline lakes and coastal estuaries.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Behaviour\">Behaviour</span></h2>\n<p>This grebe is highly gregarious, usually forming large colonies when breeding and large flocks when not.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Breeding\">Breeding</span></h3>\n<p>This species builds its floating nest in the usually shallow water of open lakes. The nest itself is anchored to the lake by plants. It is built by both the male and the female and made out of plant matter. Most of it is submerged, with the bottom of the shallow cup usually being level with the water. Above the cup, there is a flat disc. This grebe nests both in colonies and by itself. When it does not nest by itself, it will often nest in mixed-species colonies made up of  black-headed gulls, ducks, and various other waterbirds. The space between the nests in these colonies is often 1 to 2 metres (3.3 to 6.6\u00a0ft). Whether it nests in colonies or not has an effect on the dimensions of the nest. When the bird is not in a colony, the nest has an average diameter of 28 centimetres (11\u00a0in), although this can vary, with nests ranging from about 20 centimetres (8\u00a0in) to over 30 centimetres (12\u00a0in). This is compared to nests in colonies, which have an average diameter of about 25.5 centimetres (10\u00a0in). It is suggested that rarely some pairs of this grebe will steward over multiple nests when in colonies.</p>\n\n<p>Pair formation in the black-necked grebe usually starts during pauses in the migration to the breeding grounds, although it occasionally occurs before, in wintering pairs. This pair formation continues after this grebe has arrived to its breeding grounds. Courtship occurs when it arrives at the breeding lake. The displays are performed in the middle of the lake. There is no territory involved in courting; individuals used the whole area of the lake. When advertising for a mate, a black-necked grebe will approach other black-necked grebes with its body fluffed out and its neck erect. It closes its beak to perform a call, <i>poo-eee-chk</i>, with the last note only barely audible. Courtship generally stops at the start of nesting.</p><p>In the Northern Hemisphere, this bird breeds from April to August. In east Africa, the breeding season is at least from January to February, while in southern Africa, the breeding season is from October to April.</p><p>The black-necked grebe is socially monogamous. Conspecific or intraspecific brood parasitism, where the female lays eggs in the nest of others of their own species is common with nearly 40% of nests being parasitized on average. In terms of territory, this grebe will defend only its nest site.</p>\n\n<p>This grebe lays a clutch, and sometimes two clutches, of three to four chalky greenish or bluish eggs. Nests that have been parasitized, however, will have two more eggs on average, even though the number the host lays is about the same no matter if it has been parasitized or not. The eggs, although initially immaculate, do get stained by plant matter that the nest is built out of. The eggs measure 45 by 30 millimetres (1.8 by 1.2\u00a0in) on average and are incubated by both parents for about 21 days. The laying date of the eggs is somewhat synchronized, with birds in small colonies having the laying dates spread out by just a few days, compared to large colonies, where the laying date is spread out over more than 10 days.</p><p>After the chicks hatch, the birds will desert their nest. Even though the young can swim and dive during this time, they rarely do, instead staying on the parents' backs for four days after hatching. This behaviour is present in all grebes, and is likely to have evolved because it reduces travel costs, specifically those back to the nest to brood the chicks and give them food. After about 10 days, the parents split the chicks up, with each parent taking care of about half of the brood. After this split, the chicks are independent in about 10 days, and fledge in about three weeks.</p><p>When disturbed while incubating, this bird usually (just under 50% of the time) partly covers its eggs with nest material when the disruption is not sudden, but a bird with an incomplete clutch usually does not attempt to cover the eggs. When the disruption is sudden, on the other hand, the black-necked grebe usually (just under 50% of the time) does not cover its eggs. In comparison, other species of grebes cover up their eggs when leaving the nest. Predation is usually not the primary cause of egg loss, with most nesting failures occurring after the chicks have hatched. A major cause of this is the chilling of the young.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Feeding\">Feeding</span></h3>\n\n<p>The black-necked grebe forages mainly by diving from the water, with dives usually lasting less than 30 seconds. These dives are usually shorter in time when in more shallow water. In between dives, this grebe rests for an average of 15 seconds. When feeding on brine shrimp at hypersaline lakes, it likely uses its large tongue to block the oral cavity. It is hypothesized that it then crushes prey against its palate to remove excess water. It also forages by gleaning foliage, plucking objects off of the surface of water, having its head submerged while swimming, and sometimes capturing flying insects.</p><p>This grebe eats mostly insects, of both adult and larval stages, as well as crustaceans, molluscs, tadpoles, and small frogs and fish. When moulting at lakes with high salinity, although, this bird feeds mostly on brine shrimp. The behaviour of black-necked grebes changes in response to the availability of brine shrimp; bodies of water with more shrimp have more grebes, and grebes spend more time foraging when the amount of shrimp and the water temperature decreases.</p><p>The young are fed one at a time by the parents, with one bird carrying the young while the other feeds it. The young take food by grabbing it, with their beaks, from their parents, or by grabbing food dropped into the water. When a young bird cannot grab the food, then the adults submerge their bill into the water and shake their bill to break up the food.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Moult_and_migration\">Moult and migration</span></h3>\n<p>When breeding is over, the black-necked grebe usually partakes in a moult migration to saline lakes. It especially prefers lakes with large numbers of invertebrate prey, so it can fatten up while moulting and before going on its winter migration. Some birds, although, moult when on the breeding grounds, but most do not moult until the end of the moult migration. This migration is dangerous, with hundreds and sometimes thousands of birds being killed by snowstorms when traveling to places such as Mono Lake.</p><p>When it finishes its moult migration, this bird moults its remiges between August and September, which makes it unable to fly. This moult is preceded by an increase in weight. During the moult, the breast muscles atrophy. When the moult is completed, this grebe continues to gain weight, often more than doubling its original weight. This additional fat is used to power the black-necked grebe's overnight fall migration to its wintering grounds. The fat is most concentrated in the abdomen, second most in the thorax, and least in the chest. This bird usually starts its migration earlier when shrimp is more abundant and when the moulting lake is at a higher than average temperature. It generally leaves on a clear night with lower than average surface temperatures.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Movement\">Movement</span></h3>\n\n<p>This grebe is one of the most inefficient fliers among birds. Generally, it avoids flying at all costs and reserves long-distance flight exclusively for migration. This is combined with the fact that this bird is flightless for two months of the year during its moult. However, when migrating, it travels as much as 6,000 kilometres (3,700 miles) to reach rich feeding areas that are exploited by few other species. In flight, the shape of this grebe is like a loon: straight neck, legs trailing, and wings beating often.</p><p>When diving, this bird pulls its head back and then arches it forward into the water, with the body following and a slight springing. The legs start moving only after they are underwater. When swimming on the surface of the water, the body of this grebe is relatively high, although none of the underparts are seen. The neck is held straight up in a relaxed manner, with the bill being held forward and parallel to the water. Each of the feet perform strong alternating strokes.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Disease\">Disease</span></h2>\n<p>Large-scaled deaths (such as 150,000 birds on the Salton Sea in 1992) from erysipelas, avian cholera, avian botulism, and West Nile virus have been recorded in the past. In 2013 at the Great Salt Lake, for example, there was an outbreak of West Nile virus that could be the largest recorded in birds in the US. The cause of the outbreak and modes of transmission are unknown, but there has been speculation about the latter. Since West Nile virus is able to survive in brine shrimp and, for a temporary time, the water of the Great Salt Lake around the temperature it was when the die-off happened. Thus, it is likely that grebes could become infected by eating diseased shrimp or being in contaminated water. It is also theorized that West Nile virus could be transmitted among grebes through contact with the excrement of an infected grebe. Avian cholera, another disease that can cause large scale die-offs in this grebe, can be brought on by unknown biotoxins, pathogens, and problems with feather waterproofing.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Status\">Status</span></h2>\n<p>As of 2016, the black-necked grebe is classified as least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). The trend of the population is uncertain, as some populations are decreasing, whereas others are stable, have an uncertain trend, or are increasing. The justification for the current classification of this species is its very large population (estimated around 3.9\u20134.2 million individuals) combined with a large estimated extent of occurrence (about 155 million km<sup>2</sup> (60 million sq mi)). This grebe is probably the most numerous grebe in the world.</p><p>Unknown biotoxins, pathogens, and the impairment of feather waterproofing can lead to hypothermia and avian cholera. Since this grebe usually winters on the coast, it is also vulnerable to oil pollution. Large-scale disease, such as avian cholera, could threaten the species. These and other factors, such as human disturbance, including collisions with power transmission lines, contribute to declining populations in certain areas. This species used to be threatened in North America by the millinery industry, which helped facilitate the hunting of the birds, and egg collectors. Although this is true, this grebe is hunted in the Gilan Province in Iran, for both commercial and recreational purposes. However, there is no evidence suggesting that these threats could result in a significant risk for the overall population.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n\n<h2><span id=\"Bibliography\">Bibliography</span></h2>\n\n<h2><span id=\"External_links\">External links</span></h2>\n<ul><li>Eared Grebe Species Account \u2013 Cornell Lab of Ornithology</li></ul>"

It is a resident species across the Indian Subcontinent and Southeast Asia with a disjunct population in Australia. It lives in wetland habitats and certain crops such as rice and wheat where it forages for a wide range of animal prey. Adult birds of both sexes have a heavy bill and are patterned in white and glossy blacks, but the sexes differ in the colour of the iris. In Australia, it is sometimes called a jabiru although that name refers to a stork species found in the Americas. It is one of the few storks that is strongly territorial when feeding.\n</p>\n\n\n<h2><span id=\"Taxonomy_and_systematics\">Taxonomy and systematics</span></h2>\n\n<p>First described by John Latham as <i>Mycteria asiatica</i>, this species was later placed in the genus <i>Xenorhynchus</i> based on morphology. Based on behavioural similarities, Kahl suggested the placement of the species in the genus <i>Ephippiorhynchus</i>, which then included a single species, the saddle-billed stork. This placement of both the black-necked stork and saddle-billed stork in the same genus was later supported by osteological and behavioural data, and DNA-DNA hybridisation and cytochrome\u2013<i>b</i> data. The genera <i>Xenorhynchus</i> and <i>Ephippiorhynchus</i> were both erected at the same time, and as first revisor, Kahl selected the latter as the valid genus for the two species. This and the saddle-billed stork <i>Ephippiorhynchus senegalensis</i> are the only stork species that show marked sexual dimorphism in iris colour.</p><p>Two subspecies are recognized <i>E. a. asiaticus</i> of the Oriental region and <i>E. a. australis</i> of south New Guinea and Australia. Charles Lucien Bonaparte erected the genus <i>Xenorhynchus</i> in 1855 and placed two species in it, <i>X. indica</i> and <i>X. australis</i>. This treatment was carried on into later works. James Lee Peters in his 1931 work treated them as subspecies. In 1989, McAllan and Bruce again suggested the elevation of the two subspecies into two species: <i>E. asiaticus</i> or the green-necked stork of the Oriental region, and <i>E. australis</i> or the black-necked stork of the Australian and New Guinean region. This recommendation was based on the disjunct distributions and differences in the iridescent colouration of the neck which the authors suggested might reflect different behavioural displays. This recommendation has not been followed and a subsequent study did not find consistent differences in the colours. Analysis of the cytochrome b mitochondrial sequences however showed significant genetic divergence. The genetic distance of a stork presumed to be <i>Ephippiorhynchus asiaticus asiaticus</i> from a confirmed individual of <i>E. a. australis</i> was 2.1%, much greater than the genetic distances between individual storks of the same species. The conservative treatment as two subspecies has been followed in the Australian faunal list by Christidis and Boles.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Description\">Description</span></h2>\n\n<p>The black-necked stork is a large bird, 129\u2013150\u00a0cm (51\u201359\u00a0in) tall having a 230-centimetre (91\u00a0in) wingspan. The only published weight for this species was a single specimen at 4,100\u00a0g (9.0\u00a0lb), but this is nearly 35% less than the mean body mass of the closely related saddle-billed stork, which also attains a similar stature. Therefore, this specimen of black-necked stork could have been at the low end of sizes attainable or perhaps somewhat malnourished. The plumage patterns are conspicuous with younger birds differing from adults. Adults have a glossy bluish-black iridescent head, neck, secondary flight feathers and tail; a coppery-brown crown; a bright white back and belly; bill black with a slightly concave upper edge; and bright red legs. The sexes are identical but the adult female has a yellow iris while the adult male has it brown. Juveniles younger than six months have a brownish iris; a distinctly smaller and straighter beak; a fluffy appearance; brown head, neck, upper back, wings and tail; a white belly; and dark legs. Juveniles older than six months have a mottled appearance especially on the head and neck where the iridescence is partly developed; dark-brown outer primaries; white inner primaries that forms a shoulder patch when the wings are closed; a heavy beak identical in size to adults but still straighter; and dark to pale-pink legs. Like most storks, the black-necked stork flies with the neck outstretched, not retracted like a heron. In flight it appears spindly and a black bar running through the white wings (the somewhat similar looking migratory black stork has an all black wing) with black neck and tail make it distinctive.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Distribution_and_habitat\">Distribution and habitat</span></h2>\n\n<p>In India, the species is widespread in the west, central highlands, and northern Gangetic plains extending east into the Assam valley, but rare in peninsular India and Sri Lanka. This distinctive stork is an occasional straggler in southern and eastern Pakistan, and is a confirmed breeding species in central lowland Nepal. It extends into Southeast Asia, through New Guinea and into the northern half of Australia. Compared to other large waterbirds like cranes, spoonbills and other species of storks, black-necked storks are least abundant in locations with a high diversity of waterbird species.</p><p>The largest population of this species occurs in Australia, where it is found from the Ashburton River, near Onslow, Western Australia, across northern Australia to north-east New South Wales. It extends inland in the Kimberley area to south of Halls Creek; in the Northern Territory to Hooker Creek and Daly Waters; and in Queensland inland to the Boulia area and the New South Wales border, with some records as far south as the north-west plains of New South Wales, along the coast of Sydney and formerly bred near the Shoalhaven River. It is rare along the south-east extremity of its range, but common throughout the north. An estimated 1800 occur in the Alligator Rivers region of the Northern Territory, with overall numbers during surveys being low in all seasons. A combination of aerial surveys and ground counts in the middle Fly River floodplain, Papua New Guinea during estimated 317 (December 1994) and 249 (April 1995) storks.</p><p>The largest known breeding population occurs in the largely agricultural landscape of south-western Uttar Pradesh in India. Densities of about 0.099 birds per square kilometre have been estimated in this region made up of a mosaic of cultivated fields and wetlands. About six pairs were found to use the 29 square kilometres of the Keoladeo National Park. One breeding pair has been observed in Bhagalpur district, western Bihar.</p><p>In Sri Lanka, the species is a rare breeding resident, with 4\u20138 breeding pairs in Ruhuna National Park. It is exceedingly rare, and possibly no longer breeding in Bangladesh and Thailand.</p><p>Black-necked storks forage in a variety of natural and artificial wetland habitats. They frequently use freshwater, natural wetland habitats such as lakes, ponds, marshes, flooded grasslands, oxbow lakes, swamps, rivers and water meadows. Freshwater, artificial wetland habitats used by these storks include flooded fallow and paddy fields, wet wheat fields, irrigation storage ponds and canals, sewage ponds, and dry floodplains. Small numbers are also seen in Indian coastal wetland habitats, including in mangrove creeks and marshes. In cultivated areas, they prefer natural wetlands to forage in, though flooded rice paddies are preferentially used during the monsoon, likely due to excessive flooding of lakes and ponds. Nests are usually on trees located in secluded parts of large marshes or in cultivated fields as in India and lowland Nepal.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Behaviour_and_ecology\">Behaviour and ecology</span></h2>\n<p>This large stork has a dance-like display. A pair stalk up to each other face to face, extending their wings and fluttering the wing tips rapidly and advancing their heads until they meet. They then clatter their bills and walk away. The display lasts for a minute and may be repeated several times.</p>\n\n<p>Nest building in India commences during the peak of the monsoon with most of the nests initiated during September \u2013 November, with few new nests built afterwards until January. They nest on large trees, sometimes isolated in large marshes, or in agricultural landscapes, on which they build a platform. On agricultural landscapes, human disturbance can cause nesting adults to abandon nests in some locations, but storks in other locations nest successfully. The nest is large, as much as 3 to 6 feet across and made up of sticks, branches and lined with rushes, water-plants and sometimes with a mud plaster on the edges. Nests may be reused year after year. The usual clutch is four eggs which are dull white in colour and broad oval in shape, but varies from one to five eggs. The exact incubation period is not known but is expected to be about 30 days. The chicks hatch with white down which is replaced by a darker grey down on the neck within a week. The scapular feathers emerge first followed by the primaries. The young birds make a <i>chack</i> sound followed by a repeated <i>wee-wee-wee</i> calls. Adult birds take turns at the nest and when one returns to relieve the other, they perform a greeting display with open wings and an up and down movement of the head. Food is brought for the young chicks by the adults and regurgitated onto the nest platform. Adults stop feeding the young at the nest and begin to show aggression towards the chicks after they are about 3 or 4 months old. The young birds may stay on nearby for about a year but disperse soon. Typically one to three chicks fledge from successful nests, but up to five chicks fledge in years with high rainfall. The number of stork pairs that succeed in raising chicks, and the average size of fledged broods, are related to monsoonal and post-monsoon rainfall, improving in years with higher rainfall.</p><p>At the nest trees, which are typically tall with large boles and a wide-canopy, the birds in Bharatpur competed with Indian white-backed vultures sometimes failing to nest due to the vultures. While many wetland birds are flushed by birds of prey, these storks are not usually intimidated and can be quite aggressive to other large water-birds such as herons and cranes. Adults aggressively defend small depressions of deep water against egrets and herons (at Malabanjbanjdju in Kakadu National Park, Australia), and drying wetland patches against waterbirds such as spoonbills and woolly-necked storks (at Dudhwa National Park, Uttar Pradesh, India).\n</p>\n\n<p>The black-necked stork is a carnivore and its diet includes water-birds such as coots,, , darters,  little grebes, northern shoveller, pheasant-tailed jacana, and a range of aquatic vertebrates including fish, amphibians, reptiles and invertebrates such as crabs and molluscs. They also prey on the eggs and hatchlings of turtles. In the Chambal River valley they have been observed to locate nests of <i>Kachuga dhongoka</i> buried under sand (presumably by moistness of the freshly covered nest) and prey on the eggs of the turtle. In Australia, they also forage at night feeding on emerging nestlings of marine turtles. Stomach content analyses of nine storks in Australia showed their diet to contain crabs, molluscs, insects (grasshoppers and beetles), amphibians, reptiles and birds. The storks had also consumed a small piece of plastic, pebbles, cattle dung, and plant material. In well-protected wetlands, both in Australia and India, black-necked storks feed almost exclusively on fish but in the agriculture-dominated landscape of Uttar Pradesh in India they feed on a wider range of prey that include frogs and molluscs; storks obtained fish in wetlands, frogs from roadside ditches and molluscs from irrigation canals.</p><p>They sometimes soar in the heat of the day or rest on their hocks. When disturbed, they may stretch out their necks. Their drinking behaviour involves bending down with open bill and scooping up water with a forward motion followed by raising the bill to swallow water. They sometimes carry water in their bill to chicks at the nest or even during nest building or egg stages.</p><p>Like other storks, they are quite mute except at nest where they make bill-clattering sounds. The sounds produced are of a low-pitch and resonant and ends with a short sigh. Juveniles fledged from the nests can occasionally call using a mildly-warbling, high-pitched series of whistles, accompanied with open, quivering wings. These calls and behaviour are directed at adult birds and are a display to solicit food, particularly in drought years when younger birds are apparently unable to find food on their own easily.</p><p>Black-necked storks are largely non-social and are usually seen as single birds, pairs and family groups. Flocks of up to 15 storks have been observed in Australia and India, and form due to local habitat conditions such as drying out of wetlands.</p><p>The black-necked stork is the type-host for a species of ectoparasitic Ischnoceran bird louse, <i>Ardeicola asiaticus</i>  and a species of endoparasitic trematode <i>Dissurus xenorhynchi</i>.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Status_and_conservation\">Status and conservation</span></h2>\n<p>The black-necked stork is widely scattered and nowhere found in high densities, making it difficult for populations to be reliably estimated. The Sri Lankan population has been estimated to be about 50 birds while the species has become very rare in Thailand, Myanmar, Laos and Cambodia. They may be extinct in the Sundaic region. The combined South and South-east Asian population is placed at less than 1000 birds. A 2011 study found the population in south-western Uttar Pradesh to be stable, although population growth rates may decline with an increase in the number of dry years or land use changes that permanently remove the number of breeding pairs. The Australian population has been optimistically estimated at about 20,000 birds while a more conservative estimate suggests about 10,000 birds. They are threatened by habitat destruction, the draining of shallow wetlands, disturbance at nests, overfishing, pollution, collision with electricity wires and hunting. Few breeding populations with high breeding success are known primarily due to lack of field work. It is evaluated as near threatened on the IUCN Red List.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"In_culture\">In culture</span></h2>\n\n<p>The Mir Shikars, traditional bird hunters of Bihar, India had a ritual practice that required a young man to capture a black-necked stork \"Loha Sarang\" alive before he could marry. A procession would locate a bird and the bridegroom-to-be would try to catch the bird with a limed stick. The cornered bird was a ferocious adversary. The ritual was stopped in the 1920s after a young man was killed in the process. Young birds have been known to be taken from the nest for meat in Assam.</p><p>In Australia, an aboriginal creation myth describes the origin of the bill of the \"jabiru\" from a spear that went through the head of a bird. The Binbinga people often consider the meat of the bird as taboo and eating its meat would cause an unborn child to cause the death of its mother. The jabiru is known as \"karinji\" and is the totem of a group known as the Karinji people.</p><p>The difference in iris colour among the sexes was noted in 1865 by A D Bartlett, the superintendent in charge of the collection at the Zoological Society of London. The similarity in this aspect with the African saddle-billed stork was noted by Bartlett and commented on by J. H. Gurney. Charles Darwin who corresponded with Bartlett was well aware of this and used it as one of the examples of sexual dimorphism among birds. John Gould in his handbook to the birds of Australia noted that the meat of the bird \"...\u00a0has a fishy flavour, too over-powerful to admit of its being eaten by any one but a hungry explorer.\"</p>\n\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n\n<h2><span id=\"Other_sources\">Other sources</span></h2>\n<ul><li>Maheswaran, G. and Rahmani, A.

It is one of the few woodpeckers that are seen in urban areas.  It has a characteristic rattling-whinnying call and an undulating flight. It is the only golden-backed woodpecker with a black throat and a black rump.\n</p>\n\n\n<h2><span id=\"Taxonomy\">Taxonomy</span></h2>\n<p>The black-rumped flameback was described and illustrated by two pre-Linnaean English naturalists from a dried specimen that had been brought to London. In 1738 Eleazar Albin included the bird as the \"Bengall Woodpecker\" in his <i>A Natural History of Birds</i> and in 1751 George Edwards included the \"Spotted Indian Woodpecker\" in his <i>A Natural History of Uncommon Birds</i>. The black-rumped flameback was formally described by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his <i>Systema Naturae</i> under the binomial name <i>Picus benghalensis</i>. He cited the earlier descriptions by Albin and Edwards. This woodpecker is now placed in the genus <i>Dinopium</i> that was introduced by the French polymath Constantine Samuel Rafinesque in 1814.</p><p>Five subspecies are recognised:</p>\n<ul><li>The nominate subspecies (<i>D. b. benghalense</i>) is found across India in the low elevations up to about 1000\u00a0m.</li>\n<li>The race in the arid northwestern India and Pakistan, <i>D. b. dilutum</i> (Blyth, 1852), has pale yellow upperparts, a long crest and whiter underparts than the nominate race of the Gangetic plains. The upperparts have less spots. It prefers to breed in old gnarled tamarisks, <i>Acacia</i> and <i>Dalbergia</i> trunks.</li>\n<li>The Southern Peninsular form, <i>D. b. puncticolle</i> (Malherbe, 1845), has a black throat with small triangular white spots and bright golden-yellow upperparts.</li>\n<li>The subspecies found in the Western Ghats is separated as <i>D. b. tehminae</i> (Whistler &amp; Kinnear, 1934), (named after the wife of Salim Ali) and is more olive above, has fine spots on the black throat and the wing-covert spots are not distinct.</li>\n<li>The northern Sri Lankan race, <i>D. b. jaffnense</i> (Whistler, 1944), has a shorter beak.</li></ul><p>The Sri Lankan red-backed flameback (<i>Dinopium psarodes</i>) was formerly treated as a subspecies of the black-rumped flameback. It has a crimson back and all the dark markings are blacker and more extensive. It sometimes intergrades with <i>D. b. jaffnense</i> near Puttalam, Kekirawa and Trincomalee.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Description\">Description</span></h2>\n\n<p>The black-rumped flameback is a large species at 26\u201329\u00a0cm in length. It has a typical woodpecker shape, and the golden yellow wing coverts are distinctive. The rump is black and not red as in the greater flameback. The underparts are white with dark chevron markings. The black throat finely marked with white immediately separates it from other golden backed woodpeckers in the Indian region. The head is whitish with a black nape and throat, and there is a greyish eye patch. Unlike the greater flameback it has no dark moustachial stripes.</p><p>The adult male has a red crown and crest. Females have a black forecrown spotted with white, with red only on the rear crest. Young birds are like the female, but duller.</p>\n\n<p>Like other woodpeckers, this species has a straight pointed bill, a stiff tail to provide support against tree trunks, and zygodactyl feet, with two toes pointing forward, and two backward. The long tongue can be darted forward to capture insects.</p><p>The black-rumped flameback is the only golden-backed woodpecker with both a black throat and a black rump.</p><p>Leucistic birds have been recorded. Two specimens of male birds from the northern Western Ghats have been noted to have red-tipped feathers on the malar region almost forming a malar stripe. A female specimen from Lucknow has been noted to have grown an abnormal downcurved hoopoe-like bill.</p>\n\n<h2><span id=\"Distribution_and_habitat\">Distribution and habitat</span></h2>\n<p>This flameback is found mainly on the plains going up to an elevation of about 1200m in Pakistan, India south of the Himalayas and east till the western Assam valley and Meghalaya, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. It is associated with open forest and cultivation. They are often seen in urban areas with wooded avenues. It is somewhat rare in the Kutch and desert region of Rajasthan.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Behaviour_and_ecology\">Behaviour and ecology</span></h2>\n<p>This species is normally seen in pairs or small parties and sometimes joins mixed-species foraging flocks. They forage from the ground to the canopy. They feed on insects mainly beetle larvae from under the bark, visit termite mounds and sometimes feed on nectar. As they make hopping movements around branches, they often conceal themselves from potential predators. They adapt well in human-modified habitats making use of artificial constructions fallen fruits and even food scraps.</p><p>The breeding season varies with weather and is between February and July. They frequently drum during the breeding season. The nest hole is usually excavated by the birds and has a horizontal entrance and descends into a cavity. Sometimes birds may usurp the nest holes of other birds. Nests have also been noted in mud embankments. The eggs are laid inside the unlined cavity. The normal clutch is three and the eggs are elongate and glossy white. The eggs hatch after about 11 days of incubation. The chicks leave the nest after about 20 days.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"In_culture\">In culture</span></h2>\n<p>In Sri Lanka these woodpeckers go by the generic name of <i>k\u00e6ralaa</i> in Sinhala.

It is a member of the godwit genus, <i>Limosa</i>. There are three subspecies, all with orange head, neck and chest in breeding plumage and dull grey-brown winter coloration, and distinctive black and white wingbar at all times.\n</p><p>Its breeding range stretches from Iceland through Europe and areas of central Asia. Black-tailed godwits spend (the northern hemisphere) winter in areas as diverse as the Indian Subcontinent, Australia, New Zealand, western Europe and west Africa. The species breeds in fens, lake edges, damp meadows, moorlands and bogs and uses estuaries, swamps and floods in (the northern hemisphere) winter; it is more likely to be found inland and on freshwater than the similar bar-tailed godwit. The world population is estimated to be 634,000 to 805,000 birds and is classified as Near Threatened. The black-tailed godwit is the national bird of the Netherlands\n</p>\n\n\n<h2><span id=\"Taxonomy\">Taxonomy</span></h2>\n<p>This species was first described, as <i>Scolopax limosa</i>, by Carl Linnaeus in 1758. Its scientific name is derived from Latin and means \"muddy\", from <i>limus</i>, \"mud\". The English name was first recorded in about 1416\u201317 and is believed to imitate the bird's call.</p><p>The black-tailed godwit is a member of the genus <i>Limosa</i> (godwits), family Scolopacidae (sandpipers) and order Charadriiformes, the waders. There are three subspecies:</p>\n<ul><li><i>L. l. limosa</i> \u2013 <small>(Linnaeus, 1758)</small>: the European black-tailed godwit, which breeds from western and central Europe to central Asia and Asiatic Russia, as far east as the Yenisei River. Its head, neck and chest are pale orange.</li>\n<li><i>L. l. islandica</i> \u2013 <small>Brehm, 1831</small>: the Icelandic black-tailed godwit, which breeds mostly in Iceland, but also on the Faeroe Islands, Shetland and the Lofoten Islands. It has a shorter bill, shorter legs and more rufous coloration extending onto the belly, compared to <i>limosa</i>.</li>\n<li><i>L. l. melanuroides</i> \u2013 <small>Gould, 1846</small>: the Asian black-tailed godwit, which breeds in Mongolia, northern China, Siberia and far eastern Russia. Its plumage is similar to <i>islandica</i>, but the bird is distinctly smaller.</li></ul><h2><span id=\"Description\">Description</span></h2>\n\n<p>The black-tailed godwit is a large wader with long bill (7.5 to 12\u00a0cm (3.0 to 4.7\u00a0in) long), neck and legs. During the breeding season, the bill has a yellowish or orange-pink base and dark tip; the base is pink in winter. The legs are dark grey, brown or black. The sexes are similar, but in breeding plumage, they can be separated by the male's brighter, more extensive orange breast, neck and head. In winter, adult black-tailed godwits have a uniform brown-grey breast and upperparts (in contrast to the bar-tailed godwit's streaked back). Juveniles have a pale orange wash to the neck and breast.</p><p>In flight, its bold black and white wings and white rump can be seen readily. When on the ground it can be difficult to separate from the similar Bar-tailed Godwit, but the black-tailed godwit's longer, straighter bill and longer legs are diagnostic. Black-tailed godwits are similar in body size and shape to bar-taileds, but stand taller.</p><p>It measures 42\u00a0cm (17\u00a0in) from bill to tail with a wingspan of 70\u201382\u00a0cm (28\u201332\u00a0in). Males weigh around 280\u00a0g (9.9\u00a0oz) and females 340\u00a0g (12\u00a0oz). The female is around 5% larger than the male, with a bill 12\u201315% longer.</p><p>The most common call is a strident <i>weeka weeka weeka</i>.\n</p><p>A study of black-tailed godwits in the Netherlands found a mortality rate of 37.6% in the first year of life, 32% in the second year, and 36.9% thereafter.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Distribution_and_habitat\">Distribution and habitat</span></h2>\n\n<p>Black-tailed godwits have a discontinuous breeding range stretching from Iceland to the far east of Russia. Their breeding habitat is river valley fens, floods at the edges of large lakes, damp steppes, raised bogs and moorlands. An important proportion of the European population now uses secondary habitats: lowland wet grasslands, coastal grazing marshes, pastures, wet areas near fishponds or sewage works, and saline lagoons. Breeding can also take place in sugar beet, potato and rye fields in the Netherlands and Germany.</p><p>In spring, black-tailed godwits feed largely in grasslands, moving to muddy estuaries after breeding and for winter. On African wintering grounds, swamps, floods and irrigated paddy fields can attract flocks of birds. In India, inland pools, lakes and marshes are used, and occasionally brackish lakes, tidal creeks and estuaries.</p><p>Godwits from the Icelandic population winter mainly in the United Kingdom, Ireland, France and the Netherlands, though some fly on to Spain, Portugal and perhaps Morocco. Birds of the <i>limosa</i> subspecies from western Europe fly south to Morocco and then on to Senegal and Guinea-Bissau. Birds from the eastern European populations migrate to Tunisia and Algeria, then on to Mali or Chad. Young birds from the European populations stay on in Africa after their first winter and return to Europe at the age of two years. Asian black-tailed godwits winter in Australia, Taiwan, the Philippines, Indonesia, and Papua New Guinea.\n</p>\n\n<p>Black-tailed godwits are much more likely to be found on inland wetlands than the more coastal bar-tailed godwit. They migrate in flocks to western Europe, Africa, south Asia and Australia. Although this species occurs in Ireland and Great Britain all year-round, they are not the same birds. The breeding birds depart in autumn, but are replaced in winter by the larger Icelandic race. These birds occasionally appear in the Aleutian Islands and, rarely, on the Atlantic coast of North America.\n</p><p>There is an estimated global population of between 634,000 and 805,000 birds and estimated range of 7,180,000 square kilometres (2,770,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi). In 2006 BirdLife International classified this species as Near Threatened due to a decline in numbers of around 25% in the previous 15 years. It is also among the species to which the <i>Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds</i> (AEWA) applies.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Behaviour\">Behaviour</span></h2>\n<h3><span id=\"Breeding\">Breeding</span></h3>\n\n\n<p>Black-tailed godwits are mostly monogamous; although it was not recorded in a four-year study of 50\u201360 pairs, bigamy was considered \"probably frequent\". A study of the Icelandic population showed that despite spending winter apart, pairs are reunited on their breeding grounds within an average of three days of each other. If one partner does not arrive on time, 'divorce' occurs. They nest in loose colonies. Unpaired males defend a temporary territory and perform display flights to attract a mate. Several nest scrapes are made away from the courtship territory, and are defended from other godwits. Once eggs are laid, an area of 30\u201350\u00a0m (98\u2013164\u00a0ft) around the nest is defended. The nest is a shallow scrape on the ground, usually in short vegetation. The eggs may be hidden with vegetation by the incubating parent.</p><p>The single brood of three to six eggs, coloured olive-green to dark brown, measure 55\u00a0mm \u00d7\u00a037\u00a0mm (2.2\u00a0in \u00d7\u00a01.5\u00a0in) and weigh 39\u00a0g (1.4\u00a0oz) each (of which 6% is shell). Incubation lasts 22\u201324 days and is performed by both parents. The young are downy and precocial and are brooded while they are small and at night during colder weather. After hatching, they are led away from the nest and may move to habitats such as sewage farms, lake edges, marshes and mudflats. The chicks fledge after 25\u201330 days.</p><p>Black-tailed godwit productivity varies, positively, with spring temperatures.  However, during extreme events, such as a volcanic eruption, complete breeding failures can occur.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Food_and_feeding\">Food and feeding</span></h3>\n\n<p>They mainly eat invertebrates, but also aquatic plants in winter and on migration. In the breeding season, prey includes beetles, flies, grasshoppers, dragonflies, mayflies, caterpillars, annelid worms and molluscs. Occasionally, fish eggs, frogspawn and tadpoles are eaten. In water, the most common feeding method is to probe vigorously, up to 36 times per minute, and often with the head completely submerged. On land, black-tailed godwits probe into soft ground and also pick prey items from the surface.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Relationship_to_humans\">Relationship to humans</span></h2>\n<p>In Europe, black-tailed godwits are only hunted in France, with the annual total killed estimated at 6,000 to 8,000 birds. This puts additional pressure on the western European population, and the European Commission has a management plan in place for the species in its member states. In England, black-tailed godwits were formerly much prized for the table. Sir Thomas Browne (1605\u20131682) said: <i>\"[Godwits] were accounted the daintiest dish in England and I think, for the bignesse, of the biggest price.\"</i> Old names included Blackwit, Whelp, Yarwhelp, Shrieker, Barker and Jadreka Snipe. The Icelandic name for the species is Ja\u00f0rakan.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n\n<h2><span id=\"Further_reading\">Further reading</span></h2>\n<h3><span id=\"Identification\">Identification</span></h3>\n<ul><li><cite id=\"CITEREFVinicombe2010\" class=\"citation journal\">Vinicombe, Keith (1 January 2010). \"Black-tailed and Bar-tailed Godwits\". <i>Birdwatch</i>.

This Palearctic and Afrotropical species was sometimes combined with the Australian black-shouldered kite (<i>Elanus axillaris</i>) and the white-tailed kite (<i>Elanus leucurus</i>) of North and South America which together form a superspecies. This kite is distinctive, with long wings; white, grey and black plumage; and owl-like forward-facing eyes with red irises. The owl-like behaviour is even more pronounced in the letter-winged kite (<i>Elanus scriptus</i>), a nocturnal relative in Australia. Although mainly seen on plains, they are sometimes seen on grassy slopes of hills in the higher elevation regions of Asia. They are not migratory, but show nomadism in response to weather and food availability. They are well adapted to utilize periodic upsurges in rodent populations and can raise multiple broods in a single year unlike most birds of prey. Populations in southern Europe have grown in response to human activities, particularly agriculture and livestock rearing.\n</p>\n\n<h2><span id=\"Taxonomy\">Taxonomy</span></h2>\n\n<p>The black-winged kite was described by the French naturalist Ren\u00e9 Louiche Desfontaines in 1789 and given the binomial name <i>Falco caeruleus</i>. It is now one of four species in the genus <i>Elanus</i> which was introduced in 1809 by the French zoologist Jules-C\u00e9sar Savigny. The genus <i>Elanus</i> is distinctive in having very small scales covering the foot and on the underside, scutellate scales are found only under the terminal phalanges. The claw lacks a groove on the underside. The word <i> Elanus</i> is from Ancient Greek <i>elanos</i> for a \"kite\". The specific epithet <i>caeruleus</i> is the Latin for \"blue\".</p><p>There are three subspecies:</p>\n<ul><li><i>E. c. caeruleus</i> (Desfontaines, 1789) \u2013 southwest Iberian Peninsula, Africa, southwest Arabia</li>\n<li><i>E. c. vociferus</i> (Latham, 1790) \u2013 Pakistan to east China, Malay Peninsula and Indochina. The underwing secondaries are smoky grey and nearly white in the nominate subspecies.</li>\n<li><i>E. c. hypoleucus</i> Gould, 1859 \u2013 Greater and Lesser Sunda Islands, the Philippines, Sulawesi and New Guinea</li></ul><h2><span id=\"Description\">Description</span></h2>\n\n<p>This long-winged raptor is predominantly grey or white with black shoulder patches, wing tips and eye stripe. The long falcon-like wings extend beyond the tail when the bird is perched. In flight, the short and square tail is visible and it is not forked as in the typical kites of the genus <i>Milvus</i>. When perched, often on roadside wires, it often adjusts its wings and jerks its tail up and down as if to balance itself. The sexes are alike in plumage. Their large forward-facing eyes placed under a bony shelf that shades them is distinctive; their velvety plumage and zygodactyl feet are characters shared with owls and the genus has been considered as a basal group within the Accipitridae. They are thought to have been adapted for living in savanna habitats where seasonal rodent population peaks occur. Such food resources are also favoured by the owls. The inner vanes of the feathers have velvety barbules. They have a diploid chromosome number of 68 (some older studies claimed 64 for <i>E.c.caeruleus</i> and 66 for <i>E.c.vociferus</i>) with a distinct karyotype with resemblances to the kites and honey buzzards and suggesting a basal position within the diurnal birds of prey.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Distribution_and_habitat\">Distribution and habitat</span></h2><p>\nThe black-winged kite is a species primarily of open land and semi-deserts in sub-Saharan Africa and tropical Asia, but it has a foothold within Europe in Spain and Portugal. The species range appears to be expanding in southern Europe and possibly in West Asia. The first records of breeding in Europe were in the 1860s and since then they have become more widespread and populations are on the rise. It is thought that land-use changes, particularly agriculture and pastureland have helped the species.</p><p>Several geographic populations have been named as subspecies and these include the nominate subspecies which occurs in Spain, Africa and Arabia. The subspecies <i>vociferus</i> is found east of this range across South Asia and into Southeast Asia. Along Sumatra, Java, Borneo and the Philippines subspecies <i>hypoleucus</i> (sometimes considered a full species) includes the population <i>wahgiensis</i> described from New Guinea. Subspecies <i>sumatranus</i> is not always recognized. The white-tailed kite and the black-shouldered kite were formerly included with this species but have since been treated as separate species.</p><p>Although found mainly on the plains they have been seen at higher altitudes in Sikkim (3,650\u00a0m (11,980\u00a0ft)), the Nilgiris (Doddabetta, 2,670\u00a0m (8,760\u00a0ft)) and Nagaland (2,020\u00a0m (6,630\u00a0ft)).</p><p>They are said to be winter visitors in some parts of their range such as the Western Ghats.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Behaviour_and_ecology\">Behaviour and ecology</span></h2>\n\n<p>The black-winged kite breeds at different times of the year across its range. Although nesting has been noted throughout the year in India, they appear not to breed in April and May. Males establish territories and defend them from competition. Females move into the territories of males. Studies in Africa found that males were more numerous than females. Courtship is noisy and involves chases and once the pair is formed they copulate frequently. The nest is a loose platform of twigs in which 3 or 4 eggs are laid. The female spends more effort in the construction of the nest than the male. The eggs are pale creamy with spots of deep red. Both parents incubate but when the chicks hatch, the male spends more time on foraging for food. Females initially feed the young, sometimes hunting close to the nest but will also receive food from the male. After fledging the young birds continue to be dependent for food on the male parent for about 80 days, initially transferring food at perch and later in the air. Young birds have reddish brown feathers on the upperparts and on the breast. The reddish colour is derived from porphyrins and is thought to provide the young birds some camouflage. Once breeding is complete females often move on to new territories sometimes deserting before the young fledge, leaving males to feed and raise the young. Both males and females show considerable nomadism. Unlike most birds of prey, they are capable of raising multiple broods in a year, and young birds are known to disperse widely, adaptations that helps them utilize periodic rodent population surges. Their opportunistic breeding capabilities are also accompanied by irregular patterns of moult. Young birds show \"arrested\" moult, retaining feathers for a season and then rapidly moulting them in a serial descendent pattern, where more than one primary feather is moulted at the same time. The adult plumage is found after two years.</p><p>\nTheir prey includes grasshoppers, crickets and other large insects, lizards, and rodents. Injured birds, small snakes and frogs have also been reported. The black-winged kite flies slowly during hunting like a harrier, but it will also hover like a Kestrel. It has on rare occasions been known to hunt prey in flight. Perches are used for hunting and for feeding but large prey may sometimes be handled on the ground. In southern Africa, they appear to favour roadside verges for foraging and are sometimes killed by collisions with vehicles.</p><p>These birds roost communally with groups of 15 to 35 (larger numbers in Europe) converging at a large leafy tree. They are extremely silent and the calls recorded include a high-pitched squeal or a soft whistle. They call mainly during the breeding season and at the roost site.</p><p>A species of nematode, <i>Physaloptera acuticauda</i>, has been recorded as a parasite of the species in South Africa. A trematode species, <i>Neodiplostomum elani</i>,  has been described from a black-winged kite type host from Chandigarh. A feather louse <i>Degeeriella elani</i> is known from the species.</p><p>The soft feathers of black-winged kites can lead to adherence with some grass seeds which may be dispersed by the species. However such seeds can pose the risk of entangling their wings.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n\n<h2><span id=\"Other_sources\">Other sources</span></h2>\n<ul><li><cite id=\"CITEREFHume1872\" class=\"citation journal\">Hume, A.O.

It is now normally applied to the form that is widespread in Eurosiberia and Africa and which was formerly regarded as the nominate subspecies of <i>Himantopus himantopus</i> <i>sensu lato</i>. The scientific name <i>Himantopus</i> comes from the Greek meaning \"strap foot\" or \"thong foot\". Most sources today accept 2\u20134 species.

They have long pink legs, a long thin black bill and are blackish above and white below, with a white head and neck with a varying amount of black. Males have a black back, often with greenish gloss. Females' backs have a brown hue, contrasting with the black remiges. In the populations that have the top of the head normally white at least in winter, females tend to have less black on head and neck all year round, while males often have much black, particularly in summer. This difference is not clear-cut, however, and males usually get all-white heads in winter.\n</p><p>Immature birds are grey instead of black and have a markedly sandy hue on the wings, with light feather fringes appearing as a whitish line in flight.\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Taxonomy_and_systematics\">Taxonomy and systematics</span></h2>\n<p>The taxonomy of this bird is still somewhat contentious. It is one of five distinct species which were previously considered subspecies of <i>H. himantopus</i>.  <i>H. himantopus</i> <i>sensu lato</i>, is made up of one species and 5\u20137 subspecies, and was sometimes referred to as <b>common stilt</b>.

Pairs have successfully bred in Britain in 1987, and after a 27-year hiatus, two instances of successful breeding in Southern England in 2014. 13 young were fledged in southern England in 2017.</p><p>These birds pick up their food from sand or water.

        "details": "<p class=\"mw-empty-elt\">\n</p>\n<p>The <b>blue whistling thrush</b> (<i>Myophonus caeruleus</i>) is a whistling thrush that is found in the mountains of Central Asia, South Asia, China and Southeast Asia. It is known for its loud human-like whistling song at dawn and dusk. The widely distributed populations show variations in size and plumage with several of them considered as subspecies. Like others in the genus, they feed on the ground, often along streams and in damp places foraging for snails, crabs, fruits and insects.\n</p>\n\n\n<h2><span id=\"Description\">Description</span></h2>\n<p>This whistling thrush is dark violet blue with shiny spangling on the tips of the body feathers other than on the lores, abdomen and under the tail. The wing coverts are a slightly different shade of blue and the median coverts have white spots at their tips. The bill is yellow and stands in contrast. The inner webs of the flight and tail feathers is black. The sexes are similar in plumage.</p><p>It measures 31\u201335\u00a0cm (12\u201314\u00a0in) in length. Weight across the subspecies can range from 136 to 231\u00a0g (4.8 to 8.1\u00a0oz). For comparison, the blue whistling thrush commonly weighs twice as much as an American robin. This species is possibly the largest extant thrush though size overlap does occur with the similar by length great thrush and the insular Amami thrush, whose mean body mass falls around the middle of those of the whistling thrush. Among standard measurements, the wing chord can measure 15.5\u201320\u00a0cm (6.1\u20137.9\u00a0in) long, the tarsus is 4.5\u20135.5\u00a0cm (1.8\u20132.2\u00a0in) and the bill is 2.9\u20134.6\u00a0cm (1.1\u20131.8\u00a0in). Size varies across the range with larger thrushes found to the north of the species range and slightly smaller ones to the south, corresponding with Bergmann's rule. In northern China, males and females average 188\u00a0g (6.6\u00a0oz) and 171\u00a0g (6.0\u00a0oz), whereas in India they average 167.5\u00a0g (5.91\u00a0oz) and 158.5\u00a0g (5.59\u00a0oz).</p>\n\n<p>Several populations are given subspecies status. The nominate form with a black bill is found in central and eastern China. The population in Afghanistan, <i>turkestanicus</i>, is often included in the widespread <i>temminckii</i> which has a smaller bill width at the base and is found along the Himalayas east to northern Burma. The population <i>eugenei</i>, which lacks white spots on the median coverts, is found south into Thailand. Cambodia and the Malay peninsula have <i>crassirostris</i>, while <i>dichrorhynchus</i> with smaller spangles occurs further south and in Sumatra. The Javan population, <i>flavirostris</i>, has the thickest bill. The subspecies status of several populations has been questioned.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Habitat_and_distribution\">Habitat and distribution</span></h2>\n<p>It is found along the Tian Shan and Himalayas, in temperate forests and subtropical or tropical moist montane forests. The species ranges across Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Cambodia, India, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Nepal, Tajikistan, Thailand, Tibet, Turkmenistan, and Vietnam. They make altitudinal movements in the Himalayas, descending in winter.\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Behaviour_and_ecology\">Behaviour and ecology</span></h2>\n<p>The blue whistling thrush is usually found singly or in pairs. They hop on rocks and move about in quick spurts. They turn over leaves and small stones, cocking their head and checking for movements of prey. When alarmed they spread and droop their tail. They are active well after dusk and during the breeding season (April to August) they tend to sing during the darkness of dawn and dusk when few other birds are calling. The call precedes sunrise the most during November. The alarm call is a shrill <i>kree</i>. The nest is a cup of moss and roots placed in a ledge or hollow beside a stream. The usual clutch consists of 3 to 4 eggs, the pair sometimes raising a second brood. They feed on fruits, earthworms, insects, crabs and snails. Snails and crabs are typically battered on a rock before feeding. In captivity, they have been known to kill and eat mice and in the wild have been recorded preying on small birds.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n\n<h2><span id=\"External_links\">External links</span></h2>\n<ul><li>Photos, videos and sounds</li>\n<li>Calls and songs on Xeno-Canto</li>\n<li>Blue Whistling Thrush on Avibase</li>\n<li>Oriental Bird Images: <i>Blue Whistling Thrush</i>  Selected images</li></ul> "

They are seen mostly in open habitats close to water.\n</p>\n\n\n<h2><span id=\"Description\">Description</span></h2>\n\n<p>This species, like other bee-eaters, is a richly coloured, slender bird. It is predominantly green; its face has a narrow blue patch with a black eye stripe, and a yellow and brown throat; the tail is blue and the beak is black. The three outer toes are united around their bases. It can reach a length of 23\u201326\u00a0cm, including the two elongated central tail feathers which can jut two inches more than the remaining ten feathers. Sexes are alike. This species is usually found near water and like other bee-eaters it predominantly eats flying insects, especially bees (as large as the <i>Xylocopa</i> sp.), wasps and hornets, which are caught in the air by sorties from an open perch. They may also forage in flight over estuaries, backwaters and even over the sea but not far from the coast. This species probably takes bees and dragonflies in roughly equal numbers. The insects that are caught are beaten on the perch to kill and break the exoskeleton. This habit is seen in many other members of the order Coraciiformes. They call mainly in flight with a rolling chirping whistling <i>teerp</i>.</p><p>The only confusable species within its range is the blue-cheeked bee-eater which however tends to be found in drier areas.

The blue cheek patch is much smaller while the chestnut on the throat and breast darker and covering a larger area.</p><p>They breed in April to May in India nesting colonially with closely placed nest holes in a vertical vertical mudbank or even burrowing into gently sloping land. They tend to choose sandy and sandy clay loams but avoid heavier clay loams. They also prefer clear mud banks without any vegetation cover. In Sri Lanka, they have been noted to breed in artificial sand dunes created by dredging of sea sand. The nest tunnel can run nearly 2 metres deep. About 5 to 7 near spherical eggs are laid. Both the male and the female take care of the eggs. The parents guard the nest to prevent intraspecific brood parasitism and extra pair copulation. These birds also feed and roost communally. One or two helpers may join the breeding pair after incubation begins. Although males and females appear similar to the human eye, males tend to have longer central tail feather extensions and UV reflectance studies demonstrate that healthy males had darker chestnut throats and brighter green body plumage while females showed brighter blue rumps and yellow chins.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Taxonomy_and_systematics\">Taxonomy and systematics</span></h2>\n<p>This species has sometimes been considered to be conspecific with the blue-cheeked bee-eater which is a close sister taxon, the two forming a clade with the Madagascan olive bee-eater.

        "details": " <p class=\"mw-empty-elt\">\n\n</p>\n<p><b>Blyth's kingfisher</b> (<i>Alcedo hercules</i>) is the largest kingfisher in the genus <i>Alcedo</i>. Named for Edward Blyth, the species has also been known as <i>Alcedo grandis</i> and as the great blue kingfisher. Between 22 and 23 centimetres (<span>8<span>\u00a0</span><sup>5</sup>\u2044<sub>8</sub></span> and 9\u00a0in) long, the kingfisher has deep rufous underparts with a blackish blue breast patch, and brilliant cobalt blue or azure upperparts, tinged with purple. The wings are a dark blackish green, with blue speckles and tips to some of the feathers. The bill of the male is entirely black, while the female has a dark red lower mandible. The species is distinguished from the similar blue-eared kingfisher (<i>Alcedo meninting</i>) and common kingfisher (<i>Alcedo atthis</i>) by its greater size, heavy black bill, and dark lores.\n</p><p>The species breeds between the months of March and June. It builds nests at the end of tunnels dug in the banks of streams or ravines. Four to six eggs are laid, with both sexes incubating. A shy bird, it frequents small waterways, feeding on fish and insects caught by diving from a shrub close to the water. It is found along streams in evergreen forest and adjacent open country between 200 and 1,200 metres (660 and 3,900\u00a0ft), mainly between 400 and 1,000 metres (1,300 and 3,300\u00a0ft). The species ranges from Nepal through India, Bangladesh, Bhutan, China, Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, and Vietnam. Even within its preferred habitat the density of the species is low, and the population, though not thoroughly surveyed, is believed to be small, and declining further. The International Union for Conservation of Nature classifies it as \"near threatened\".\n</p>\n\n\n<h2><span id=\"Taxonomy\">Taxonomy</span></h2>\n<p>Blyth's kingfisher was described by the English zoologist Edward Blyth in 1845 and given the binomial name <i>Alcedo grandis</i>. Unfortunately, this name was preoccupied as it had already been introduced for another species by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in his <i>Systema naturae</i> of 1788. In 1917, the German naturalist Alfred Laubmann proposed the binomial name <i>Alcedo hercules</i> to replace the preoccupied name chosen by Blyth. The common name commemorates Edward Blyth (1810\u20131873), who was the curator of the Museum of the Asiatic Society of Bengal.  Blyth's kingfisher is most closely related to the blue-eared kingfisher (<i>Alcedo meninting</i>). The species is monotypic. It has also been referred to as the great blue kingfisher.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Description\">Description</span></h2>\n<p>Blyth's kingfisher is between 22 and 23 centimetres (<span>8<span>\u00a0</span><sup>5</sup>\u2044<sub>8</sub></span> and 9\u00a0in) in length, making it the largest of the <i>Alcedo</i> kingfishers. The wing of the male is between 9.6 and 10.2 centimetres (<span>3<span>\u00a0</span><sup>3</sup>\u2044<sub>4</sub></span> and 4\u00a0in) long, and that of the female between 9.5 and 10.3 centimetres (<span>3<span>\u00a0</span><sup>3</sup>\u2044<sub>4</sub></span> and 4\u00a0in). On the male, the feathering on the head is black, with shiny tips of bright blue. It has a neck patch that is whitish or buff in colour, as is the chin. The breast and belly are rufous, except for a dark blackish-blue patch on the breast. The legs and feet of the bird are also red. The bill is entirely black in the male, while the female has a red base to the mandible. The iris of the bird is reddish brown. The lores of the bird are black, and have a buff coloured streak above them. The back of the bird from mantle to the tail coverts is a bright cobalt blue or azure, with a tinge of purple towards the rump and the tail coverts. When the bird is at rest, the upper parts may appear brownish black. The tail itself is a darker ultramarine blue. The wings and the scapular feathers are a dark greenish black. The feathers of the upperwing coverts have cobalt-blue tips, while the underwing coverts are dark rufous-red. The lesser and median coverts have prominent speckles of cobalt. Any distinctive features in the plumage of the juvenile are not known.</p><p>The species is morphologically similar to the blue-eared kingfisher (<i>Alcedo meninting</i>), but in comparison is substantially larger. Its bill is heavier and longer than that of the blue-eared kingfisher, and is entirely black. Its crown and wings are less brilliant as those of the smaller bird, and it may be distinguished by the speckles of light blue on its crown and wing coverts. The dark ear coverts set it apart from the common kingfisher (<i>Alcedo atthis</i>), which has rufous ear-coverts. It is similar to the female blue-banded kingfisher (<i>Alcedo euryzona</i>), but the two species do not overlap in their range.</p><p>The call of the species is described as a loud \"pseet\", less shrill but louder and more hoarse than that of the common kingfisher, and similar but louder to that of the blue-eared kingfisher. One of the calls made by the slaty-backed forktail (<i>Enicurus schistaceus</i>) is sometimes mistaken for the call of Blyth's kingfisher.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Behavior_and_ecology\">Behavior and ecology</span></h2>\n\n<p>The breeding period of Blyth's kingfisher is chiefly between April and May, extending to March and June. The nests are built at the end of a tunnel in a muddy bank, next to either a stream or a ravine in the forest. The tunnel extends straight, then rises, before descending to the chamber in which the nest is. This chamber is between 15 and 20 centimetres (6 and 8\u00a0in) wide and 10 and 13 centimetres (4 and 5\u00a0in) high. The width of the tunnel is typically 8 centimetres (<span>3<span>\u00a0</span><sup>1</sup>\u2044<sub>8</sub></span>\u00a0in): the length varies with the soil, ranging from 45 to 60 centimetres (<span>17<span>\u00a0</span><sup>1</sup>\u2044<sub>2</sub></span> to <span>23<span>\u00a0</span><sup>1</sup>\u2044<sub>2</sub></span>\u00a0in) in hard soil to 2 metres (6\u00a0ft 7\u00a0in) in sandy soil. Between four and six eggs are laid, incubated by both parents. The parents sit very tight; nests become covered in faecal matter. The periods of incubation and fledging are not known.</p><p>The species feeds on fish and insects it catches by diving in water bodies. Unlike other <i>Alcedo</i> kingfishers, Blyth's kingfisher dives from a shrub close above the water, rather than from an exposed vantage point. The species is presumed not to migrate. It is described as a shy bird.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Habitat_and_distribution\">Habitat and distribution</span></h2>\n<p>Blyth's kingfisher frequents small rivers and waterways in evergreen forest, hilly regions, or deep ravines. It is sometimes found near streams near well-wooded farmland. Its elevational range is chiefly between 400 and 1,000 metres (1,300 and 3,300\u00a0ft) above sea level, extending to a minimum of 200 metres (660\u00a0ft) and a maximum of 1,200 metres (3,900\u00a0ft).</p><p>The density of the species is low across its range. In China, it is known to be found in the Mengyang Nature Reserve in Yunnan, and in the Nonggang National Nature Reserve and Diding Nature Reserve in Guangxi province. It is also known to be present in Hainan. In Vietnam the species is found in Annam and western Tonkin, in which regions it is fairly common. In northern Laos and the Annamite mountains, it may be locally common. It is also found in Myanmar, where its density varies considerably, and is either a visitor or a rare resident in northwestern Thailand. It is rare in Bhutan in northeastern India, and a vagrant in Bangladesh and eastern Nepal. Its range in northeast India includes the eastern Himalayas, up to 1,200 metres (3,900\u00a0ft).</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Status_and_conservation\">Status and conservation</span></h2>\n<p>The population of Blyth's kingfisher has not been quantified globally. In China, the species is estimated to have fewer than 100 breeding pairs. The species occurs at a low density even within a favorable habitat. The habitats it favors are being degraded and fragmented by human activity. Other potential threats to the species include water pollution in the rivers it inhabits and anthropogenic disturbance such as deforestation. No specific conservation actions are known to have been taken to protect the species. Due to the presence of human disturbance, its population is thought to be in slow decline. The International Union for Conservation of Nature categorizes the species as \"near threatened\"; it has previously classified the species as \"vulnerable.\"</p>\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n\n<h2><span id=\"External_links\">External links</span></h2>\n<ul><li>Oriental Bird Images: <i>Blyth's Kingfisher</i>  Selected images</li></ul>"

        "details": "<p class=\"mw-empty-elt\">\n\n</p>\n\n<p>The <b>Bohemian waxwing</b> (<i>Bombycilla garrulus</i>) is a starling-sized passerine bird that breeds in the northern forests of the Palearctic and North America. It has mainly buff-grey plumage, black face markings and a pointed crest. Its wings are patterned with white and bright yellow, and some feather tips have the red waxy appearance that give this species its English name. The three subspecies show only minor differences in appearance. Females are similar to males, although young birds are less well-marked and have few or no waxy wingtips. Although the Bohemian waxwing's range overlaps those of the cedar and Japanese waxwings, it is easily distinguished from them by size and plumage differences.\n</p><p>The breeding habitat is coniferous forests, usually near water. The pair build a lined cup-shaped nest in a tree or bush, often close to the trunk. The clutch of 3\u20137 eggs is incubated by the female alone for 13\u201314\u00a0days to hatching. The chicks are altricial and naked, and are fed by both parents, initially mostly with insects, but thereafter mainly fruit. They fledge about 14\u201316\u00a0days after leaving the egg. Many birds desert their nesting range in winter and migrate farther south. In some years, large numbers of Bohemian waxwings irrupt well beyond their normal winter range in search of the fruit that makes up most of their diet.\n</p><p>Waxwings can be very tame in winter, entering towns and gardens in search of food, rowan berries being a particular favourite. They can metabolise alcohol produced in fermenting fruit, but can still become intoxicated, sometimes fatally. Other hazards include predation by birds of prey, infestation by parasites and collisions with cars or windows. The Bohemian waxwing's high numbers and very large breeding area mean that it is classified as being of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.\n</p>\n\n\n<h2><span id=\"Taxonomy\">Taxonomy</span></h2>\n<p>The waxwings are a family, Bombycillidae, of short-tailed stocky birds with soft plumage, a head crest and distinctively patterned wings and tails. There are three species, the Bohemian, cedar, and Japanese waxwings. DNA studies and shared features such as a relatively large size, grey underparts and similar undertail patterns suggest that the Japanese and Bohemian waxwings are most closely related within the genus. Although only the cedar and Bohemian waxwings normally have red tips on their wing feathers, this feature is occasionally shown by the Japanese waxwing, suggesting that this was originally a whole-family characteristic that has been lost in one species, rather than an indicator of a close relationship. DNA analysis confirms that the cedar waxwing diverged early from the other members of the family. Outside the genus, the closest relatives of the waxwings are believed to be the silky-flycatchers, the palmchat, and the grey hypocolius, all of which have sometimes been included in the Bombycillidae.</p><p>The Bohemian waxwing was described by Linnaeus in his <i>Systema naturae</i> in 1758 as <i>Lanius Garrulus</i>. The waxwings were moved to their own genus, <i>Bombycilla</i>, by Vieillot in 1808. The genus name <i>Bombycilla</i> comes from the Greek <i>bombux</i>, \"silk\" and the Modern Latin <i>cilla</i>, \"tail\"; this is a direct translation of the German <i>Seidenschwanz</i>, \"silk-tail\", and refers to the silky-soft plumage of the bird. The species name <i>garrulus</i> is the Latin for <i>talkative</i> and was applied to this bird, as \"Garrulus Bohemicus\", by Conrad Gessner in 1555; the term is a reference to a supposed likeness to the Eurasian jay (<i>Garrulus glandarius</i>) rather than to the waxwing's vocalisations. The English name \"waxwing\" refers to the bright red tips of the secondary feathers on its wings, which look like drops of sealing wax, while \"Bohemian\" follows Gessner's usage, and may refer to the Romani, alluding to the bird's wanderings, or to its presumed origin from Bohemia. \"Waxwing\" and \"Bohemian waxwing\" were first recorded in 1817, the former as a reference to Vieillot's separation of this bird from the \"chatterers\".</p><p>There are three recognised subspecies:</p>\n<ul><li><i>B. g. garrulus</i> (Linnaeus, 1758): the nominate subspecies. Breeds in northern Europe from northern Sweden east to the Ural Mountains.</li>\n<li><i>B. g. centralasiae</i> (Poliakov, 1915): breeds from the Urals eastwards across northern Asia.</li>\n<li><i>B. g. pallidiceps</i> (Reichenow, 1908): breeds in northwestern North America.</li></ul><p>The differences between these forms are small and clinal, and the species could be possibly considered as monotypic. The fossil record includes Pleistocene deposits from the UK and the Carpathian Mountains.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Description\">Description</span></h2>\n\n<p>The Bohemian waxwing is a starling-sized bird 19\u201323\u00a0cm (7.5\u20139.1\u00a0in) in length with a 32\u201335.5\u00a0cm (12.6\u201314.0\u00a0in) wingspan, and an average weight of 55\u00a0g (1.9\u00a0oz). It is short-tailed, mainly brownish-grey, and has a conspicuous crest on its head. The male of the nominate subspecies has a black mask through the eye and a black throat. There is a white streak behind the bill and a white curve below the eye. The lower belly is a rich chestnut colour and there are cinnamon-coloured areas around the mask. The rump is grey and the tail ends in a bright yellow band with a broad black border above it. The wings are very distinctive; the flight feathers are black and the primaries have markings that produce a yellow stripe and white \"fishhooks\" on the closed wing. The adult's secondaries end in long red appendages with the sealing wax appearance that gives the bird its English name. The eyes are dark brown, the bill is mainly black, and the legs are dark grey or black. In flight, the waxwing's large flocks, long wings and short tail give some resemblance to the common starling, and its flight is similarly fast and direct. It clambers easily through bushes and trees but only shuffles on the ground.</p><p>The soft, dense feathers are kept in good condition by preening. The red waxy tips are the extended and flattened ends of feather shafts, pigmented with astaxanthin and enclosed in a transparent sheath. A study of the cedar waxwings showed that the red tips are few or absent until the third year of life for that related species. All adult waxwings have a complete moult annually between August and January. Juveniles moult at the same time but retain their flight and some other wing feathers.</p><p>The female Bohemian waxwing is very similar to the male, but has a narrower yellow terminal band to the tail, a less defined lower edge to the black throat and slightly less distinctive wing markings. Juveniles are duller than adults, with whiter underparts, only a few red wing tips, no black on the throat and a smaller black face mask. Compared to the nominate subspecies, eastern <i>B. g. centralasiae</i> is paler, greyer and has little reddish-brown behind the bill. The American subspecies <i>B. g. pallidiceps</i> has more colouring on the cheeks and forehead than the nominate form and is otherwise generally duller in appearance.</p>\n<p>The range of the Bohemian waxwing overlaps those of both the other members of the genus. The cedar waxwing is smaller than the Bohemian; it has browner upperparts, a white undertail and a white line above the black eye patch. Adult cedar waxwings have a yellowish belly, and all ages have less strongly patterned wings than the Bohemian waxwing. The Japanese waxwing is easily distinguished from its relatives; it has a red terminal band to the tail, the black mask extends up the rear of the crest, and there is no yellow stripe or red tips on the wings.</p><p>The Bohemian waxwing's call is a high trill <i>sirrrr</i>. It is less wavering and lower-pitched than that of the cedar waxwing, and longer and lower-pitched than the call of the Japanese waxwing. Other calls are just variants of the main vocalisation; a quieter version is used by chicks to call parents, and courtship calls, also given during nest construction, have a particularly large frequency range. Although not a call as such, when a flock takes off or lands, the wings make a distinctive rattling sound that can be heard 30\u00a0m (98\u00a0ft) away.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Distribution_and_habitat\">Distribution and habitat</span></h2>\n\n<p>The Bohemian waxwing has a circumpolar distribution, breeding in northern regions of Eurasia and North America. In Eurasia, its northern nesting limit is just short of the treeline, roughly at the 10\u00a0\u00b0C July isotherm, and it breeds south locally to about 51\u00b0N. Most birds breed between 60\u201367\u00b0N, reaching 70\u00b0N in Scandinavia. The North American subspecies breeds in the northwestern and north central areas of the continent, its range extending southwards beyond the US border in the Rocky Mountains.</p><p>This waxwing is migratory with much of the breeding range abandoned as the birds move south for the winter. Migration starts in September in the north of the range, a month or so later farther south. Eurasian birds normally winter from eastern Britain through northern parts of western and central Europe, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and northern China to Japan. North American breeders have a more southeasterly trend, many birds wintering in southeast Canada, with smaller numbers in the north central and northeastern US states. Birds do not usually return to the same wintering sites in successive years. One bird wintering in the Ukraine was found 6,000\u00a0km (3,700\u00a0mi) to the east in Siberia in the following year.</p>\n\n<p>In some years, this waxwing irrupts south of its normal wintering areas, sometimes in huge numbers. The fruit on which the birds depend in winter varies in abundance from year to year, and in poor years, particularly those following a good crop the previous year, the flocks move farther south until they reach adequate supplies. They will stay until the food runs out and move on again. In what may be the largest ever irruption in Europe, in the winter of 2004\u20132005, more than half a million waxwings were recorded in Germany alone. This invasion followed an unusually warm, dry breeding season. In 1908, an American flock 60\u201390\u00a0m (200\u2013300\u00a0ft) wide was noted as taking two to three minutes to fly over.</p><p>The breeding habitat is mature conifers, often spruce although other conifers and broadleaf trees may also be present. More open, wet areas such as lakes and peat swamps with dead and drowned trees are used for feeding on insects. Lowlands, valleys and uplands are used in Eurasia, although mountains tend to be avoided. However, the North American subspecies nests in Canada at altitudes between 900\u20131,550\u00a0m (2,950\u20135,090\u00a0ft). Outside the breeding season, the waxwing will occupy a wide range of habitats as long as suitable fruits such as rowan are available. It may be found by roads, in parks and gardens or along hedges or woodlands edges. It shows little fear of humans at this time. In winter, waxwings roost communally in dense trees or hedges, sometimes with American robins, fieldfares or other wintering species.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Behaviour\">Behaviour</span></h2>\n<h3><span id=\"Breeding\">Breeding</span></h3>\n\n<p>Bohemian waxwings start their return from the wintering grounds in February or March, but northern breeders do not reach their breeding areas until April or early May. This monogamous species nests mainly from mid June to July.</p>\n\n<p>Waxwings are not highly territorial, and, although normally solitary breeders, several pairs may nest close together where there are a number of good nest sites. Males may sometimes deter rivals from approaching their mates, and females may squabble over nest sites. Aggression is shown by sleeking down the feathers and crest, showing the black throat, and opening the bill. The breeding display is almost the opposite of this; the male erects his body and crest feathers, and turns his head away from the female. The male may repeatedly present a gift of a small item, often food, to his partner, placing it in her open bill. In about 90% of cases, this display does not lead to copulation. Older males have more red tips to the wings and are preferred by females.</p>\n\n<p>The nest, built by both sexes, is a cup of thin twigs lined with softer material such as fine grass, moss, fur or lichen. It is constructed 1.3\u201315\u00a0m (4\u201350\u00a0ft) above the ground in a pine or scrub, commonly close to the trunk. The eggs are a glossy pale blue spotted with black and grey and the clutch is 3\u20137 eggs, although five or six is most common. The average size of the egg is 24\u00a0mm \u00d7\u00a018\u00a0mm (0.94\u00a0in \u00d7\u00a00.71\u00a0in), and it weighs 3.8\u00a0g (0.13\u00a0oz), of which 5% is shell. The eggs are incubated for 13\u201314\u00a0days by the female alone. She is fed regurgitated berries by her mate, and rarely leaves the nest. The chicks are altricial and naked, and have bright red mouths; they are fed by both parents, although the male brings most of the food, mainly insects, in the first few days. The young are subsequently fed largely with fruit. The chicks fledge about 14\u201316\u00a0days after hatching. They are fed by the adults for about two weeks after fledging.</p><p>Breeding densities of this waxwing are typically low compared to other passerines, usually less than ten birds per square kilometre (26\u00a0per square mile) even in good habitat, although up to 35\u00b76\u00a0birds per square kilometre (92\u00a0per square mile) have been found in Russia. One brood each year is normal. Maximum recorded ages are 5\u00a0years 10\u00a0months in North America and more than 13\u00a0years 6\u00a0months in Europe. The average life expectancy is unknown. Significant causes of death include predation, collisions with windows and cars, and poisoning by road salt consumed when drinking.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Feeding\">Feeding</span></h3>\n\n<p>Waxwings are primarily fruit eaters, but also consume insects during the breeding season. Mosquitoes and midges are the most common prey, but many other insects and some spiders are eaten. They are caught mainly by flycatching from an open perch, but some may be picked off vegetation. Fruit is normally picked from trees, sometimes from the ground, and is usually swallowed whole. In the summer, <i>Vaccinium</i> and <i>Rubus</i> species and Canada buffaloberry are important items of their diet, while cotoneaster, juniper, haws, rose hips and apples predominate outside the breeding season. Rowan berries are a favourite food, and are eaten whenever available.</p><p>Waxwings can eat huge numbers of berries, each bird sometimes consuming several hundred a day, more than double its own weight. One individual was recorded as eating between 600 and 1,000 cotoneaster berries in six hours, and defecating every four minutes. Waxwings travel significant distances when feeding and help to disperse the fruit seeds. Waxwings forage in large flocks, sometimes of several hundred birds, which enables them to overwhelm birds such as mistle thrushes attempting to defend their fruit trees.</p>\n\n<p>Fruit is rich in sugar but deficient in other nutrients, so it must be eaten in large quantities. Bohemian waxwings have a large liver which helps to convert sugar to energy. They can metabolise ethanol produced from the fermentation of those sugary fruits more efficiently than humans, but may still become intoxicated, sometimes fatally. Waxwings often drink water or eat snow in winter, since the sugar in their fruit diet tends to dehydrate the birds through an osmotic effect. In the summer, the fruits are juicier and water is less of a problem.</p><p>In the past, the arrival of waxwings sometimes coincided with epidemics of cholera or plague, and led to the old Dutch and Flemish name <i>Pestvogel</i>, \"plague bird\". The juniper berries on which they fed were thought to offer protection, and people consumed the fruit and burned branches to fumigate their houses.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Predators_and_parasites\">Predators and parasites</span></h2>\n\n<p>Waxwings are preyed upon by birds of prey including rough-legged buzzards, Eurasian sparrowhawks, prairie falcons, and great grey shrikes. Merlins attack winter flocks, including those in cities. When alarmed, Bohemian waxwings \"freeze\" with bill and neck pointing upwards. If this fails, they fly, calling noisily.</p><p>Bohemian waxwings are not brood parasitised by the common cuckoo or its relatives in Eurasia because the cuckoo's young cannot survive on a largely fruit diet. In North America, the waxwing's breeding range has little overlap with brown-headed cowbird, another parasitic species. Nevertheless, eggs of other birds placed in a Bohemian waxwing's nest are always rejected. This suggests that in the past, perhaps 3\u00a0million years ago, the ancestral waxwing was a host of a brood parasitic species, and retains the rejection behaviour acquired then.</p><p>Parasitic mites include <i>Syringophiloidus bombycillae</i>, first identified on this species, and the nasal mite <i>Ptilonyssus bombycillae</i>. Blood parasites include <i>Trypanosoma</i> species, and a <i>Leucocytozoon</i> first identified in this waxwing. Bohemian waxwings may carry flatworms and tapeworms, but levels of parasitic worm infestation are generally low.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Status\">Status</span></h2>\n<p>The global population of the Bohemian waxwing has been estimated at more than three\u00a0million birds, and the breeding range covers about 12.8\u00a0million\u00a0km<sup>2</sup> (4.9\u00a0million\u00a0mi<sup>2</sup>). Although this species' population, as of 2013, appears to be declining, the decrease is not rapid nor large enough to trigger conservation vulnerability criteria. Given its high numbers and huge breeding area, this waxwing is therefore classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as being of least concern.  The woodlands used by this species are well to the north of major human populations, and the birds can use disturbed habitats, so there are no serious long-term threats to this species.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Notes\">Notes</span></h2>\n\n\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n\n<h2><span id=\"Cited_texts\">Cited texts</span></h2>\n<ul><li><cite id=\"CITEREFBrazil2009\" class=\"citation book\">Brazil, Mark (2009). <i>Birds of East Asia</i>.

The common name of the bird commemorates the Italian ornithologist and collector Franco Andrea Bonelli, who is credited with gathering the type specimen, mostly likely from an exploration of Sardinia. Some antiquated texts also refer to this species as the <b>crestless hawk-eagle</b>. Like all eagles, Bonelli's eagle belongs to the family Accipitridae. Its feathered legs marked it as member of the Aquilinae or booted eagle subfamily. This species breeds from southern Europe, Africa on the montane perimeter of the Sahara Desert and across the Indian Subcontinent to Indonesia. On the great Eurasian continent, this may be found a nesting species as far west as Portugal and as far east as southeastern China and Thailand. It is usually a resident breeder. The Bonelli's eagle is often found in hilly or mountainous habitats, with rocky walls or crags and open to wooded land, in arid to semi-moist climate, from sea level to 1,500\u00a0m (4,900\u00a0ft). This eagle, though it can be considered partially opportunistic, is something of a special predator of certain birds and mammals, especially rabbits, galliforms and pigeons. On evidence, when staple prey populations decline or are locally scarce, Bonelli's eagle switch to being an opportunistic predator of a wide variety of birds. Despite its persistence over a large range and its continued classification as a least concern species by the IUCN, the Bonelli's eagle has declined precipitously in various parts of its range, including almost all of its European distribution, and may face potential local extinction due to widespread habitat destruction, electrocution from electricity pylons and persistent persecution.</p>\n\n\n<h2><span id=\"Taxonomy\">Taxonomy</span></h2>\n<p>Bonelli's eagle is a member of the Aquilinae or booted eagles, a rather monophyletic subfamily of the accipitrid family. At least 38 species are currently housed in the subfamily, all with signature well-feathered tarsi. The African hawk-eagle (<i>Aquila spilogaster</i>) was once lumped with  the Bonelli's eagle but several morphological differences between the two species, life history discrepancies and their considerably allopatric distribution lead them to being considered separate species. Despite the differences between the Bonelli's eagle and the African hawk-eagle the two species are visibly similar and are still considered sister species. Recent DNA research resulted in the two species being moved, in 2014, to the genus <i>Aquila</i> from <i>Hieraaetus</i>, along with another dissimilar species, the Cassin's hawk-eagle (<i>Aquila africana</i>). More specifically and surprisingly, Bonelli's, African hawk- and Cassin's hawk-eagles were found to be genetically closely related to the golden eagle (<i>Aquila chrysaetos</i>) species complex, which also includes Verreaux's eagle (<i>Aquila verreauxii</i>), Gurney's eagle (<i>Aquila gurneyi</i>) and wedge-tailed eagle (<i>Aquila audax</i>). These species are all rather larger than the Bonelli's and African hawk-eagles with differing proportions to their wings, tail and legs (in adaptation to their open country habits) and much darker coloured plumages. Furthermore, the four other traditional members of the genus <i>Aquila</i> have been revealed to be a separate species complex despite showing superficial similarity to the golden eagle group, i.e. being relatively large and long winged with usually rather dark colours. Beyond the nominate subspecies of Bonelli's eagle, which is found throughout its range in Eurasia, a second subspecies dwells in the Lesser Sunda Islands, <i>A. f. renschi</i>. The latter race is linearly smaller, and compared to other Bonelli's eagles tends to have more strikingly barred remiges and tail, the belly, thighs and crissum more boldly marked. At one time, its restricted and very isolated range have caused authors to suggest <i>A. f. renschi</i> may be a full species but recent studies have indicated that it is not genetically distinct enough to be considered a separate species. Furthermore, the most recent analysis couldn't rule out early introductions (possibly by ancient falconers) at least playing a part in the species presence in the Lesser Sundas, as some other established wild birds on those islands are certain to have reached there by early human introductions.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Description\">Description</span></h2>\n<h3><span id=\"Size_and_form\">Size and form</span></h3>\n\n<p>The Bonelli's eagle is a fairly large bird of prey and a medium-sized eagle. When still classified as a member of the genus <i>Hieraaetus</i>, it was considered the largest extant species therein, however, as a member of <i>Aquila</i> it is amongst the smallest-bodied species. Amongst the currently accepted species of <i>Aquila</i> eagles, it is of similar size to the tawny eagle (<i>Aquila rapax</i>), slightly larger than the African hawk-eagle and notably larger than the Cassin's hawk-eagle. Like most birds of prey, the Bonelli's eagle displays reverse sexual dimorphism as the female is larger than the male to the contrary of most other kinds of birds, in this case she may average about 10% larger overall. Total length in fully-grown eagles of the species can vary from 55 to 74\u00a0cm (22 to 29\u00a0in). Wingspan in males can vary from 143 to 163\u00a0cm (4\u00a0ft 8\u00a0in to 5\u00a0ft 4\u00a0in) while that of the female may vary from 156 to 180\u00a0cm (5\u00a0ft 1\u00a0in to 5\u00a0ft 11\u00a0in). Prior claims put the weight of this species as 1.4 to 2.4\u00a0kg (3.1 to 5.3\u00a0lb), however this probably slightly underrepresents both their size and the sexual dimorphism of this eagle. A large sample of full grown males from western Europe were found to average 1.94\u00a0kg (4.3\u00a0lb), with a range of 1.4 to 2.24\u00a0kg (3.1 to 4.9\u00a0lb) (sample size of 91), while 87 females were found to average 2.62\u00a0kg (5.8\u00a0lb), with a range of 2.1 to 3.03\u00a0kg (4.6 to 6.7\u00a0lb). Mature males from western Europe were found to have averaged 65\u00a0cm (26\u00a0in) in total length and 155\u00a0cm (5\u00a0ft 1\u00a0in) in wingspan while mature females averaged 70.7\u00a0cm (27.8\u00a0in) in total length and 167.8\u00a0cm (5\u00a0ft 6\u00a0in) in wingspan. Although the linear measurements reportedly increase slightly in average size in the eastern Asian part of the range, body weight was similar or slightly lower at a mean of 1.5\u00a0kg (3.3\u00a0lb) and 2.5\u00a0kg (5.5\u00a0lb) for males and females from the Indian subcontinent, respectively, though the sample size is unknown in this case.</p>\n\n<p>Bonelli's eagles in general form appear to have a medium-sized head on a fairly long neck, a strong bill, a fairly long tail and exceptionally long and well feathered legs. The combination of its well-proportioned, fairly stout body and elongated legs may lend to descriptions of the species as \u201cathletic\u201d in appearance. This eagle often perches with a very upright carriage, at times openly on a rock, a crag, tree branches or some form of post but also in the  foliage of tree cover, especially when actively hunting. When perched, the wing tips tend to fall a bit short of the tail tip. Among standard linear measurements, the wing chord of males varies from 458 to 542\u00a0mm (18.0 to 21.3\u00a0in), with an average in western Europe of 480.4\u00a0mm (18.91\u00a0in), in tail length from 237 to 287\u00a0mm (9.3 to 11.3\u00a0in), with an average of 268.1\u00a0mm (10.56\u00a0in), in tarsus length from 93 to 120\u00a0mm (3.7 to 4.7\u00a0in), with an average of 99.5\u00a0mm (3.92\u00a0in) and in total bill length from 40.4 to 45.3\u00a0mm (1.59 to 1.78\u00a0in), with an average of 43.3\u00a0mm (1.70\u00a0in). Meanwhile, females vary in wing chord from 478 to 560\u00a0mm (18.8 to 22.0\u00a0in), in tail length from 246 to 319\u00a0mm (9.7 to 12.6\u00a0in), with an average of 288.5\u00a0mm (11.36\u00a0in), in tarsus length from 93 to 127\u00a0mm (3.7 to 5.0\u00a0in), with an average of 119.1\u00a0mm (4.69\u00a0in), and in total bill length from 41.3 to 51.8\u00a0mm (1.63 to 2.04\u00a0in), with an average of 46.6\u00a0mm (1.83\u00a0in). Two males from the <i>A. f. renschi</i> race measured 444 and 452\u00a0mm (17.5 and 17.8\u00a0in) in wing chord length and a single female measured 493\u00a0mm (19.4\u00a0in). The Bonelli's eagle is roughly intermediate in its wing lengths and tail length proportionately between the shorter-tailed and longer-winged eagles of open country and longer-tailed and shorter-winged forest eagles, which allows to vary its hunting between short-burst, agile surprise attacks in trees and ample ground-covering pursuits in the open. Its talons and feet are proportionately very large and presumably rather powerful for the eagle's size. In particular the elongated talon on its rear toe (used as a killing apparatus by almost all accipitrids), or hallux claw, is longer than that of the much larger eastern imperial eagle (<i>Aquila heliaca</i>) and proportionately slightly larger even than its powerful sympatric competitor, the twice as massive golden eagle. Hallux claw lengths in Bonelli's eagles from western Europe averaged 37.21\u00a0mm (1.465\u00a0in) in males and in females averaged 43.1\u00a0mm (1.70\u00a0in), and could farther range up to 47\u00a0mm (1.9\u00a0in).</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Colouring_and_identification\">Colouring and identification</span></h3>\n\n<p>Adult are dark brown above, from a cold hue similar to dark chocolate to an umber hue depending on their state of molt as well as to some extent individual and regional variances, with pale margins to most feathers. These pale margins are especially broad on the median wing coverts (which thus appear lighter brown overall). Adults also have a variably-sized, irregular white patch on the mantle that can vary from nearly absent (though almost never completely so) to being quite large and extending to the upper back. The adult's tail is grey with obscure darker brown thin bars, with a broad blackish subterminal band and creamy white tip. The adult Bonelli's head is dark brown with a paler, often streaky neck and a white throat. The underside has a cream base colour with variable amounts of sparse blackish-brown streaks or drop shaped markings. The adult female averages darker and more heavily patterned than the adult male, particular on the underside, a case of colour sexual dimorphism otherwise seemingly rare in booted eagles. The streaking on this eagle is normally strongest on the breast and upper flanks while the lower belly and crissum are typically either plain or only faintly marked. Juveniles are a lighter medium brown above with variable paler edges, sometimes with a creamy patch on the back (not the mantle as in the adults) and uppertail coverts. Generally, juveniles have a rusty-brown head with a darker brown around and behind their eyes. The juvenile eagle's crown is either darkly streaked or, occasionally, plain greyish. The tail of young birds is more clearly barred than the adults while the subterminal band is only negligibly thicker than the other bars. Like adults, the juvenile Bonelli's eagle's tail has a thin white tip. The juvenile is light rufous to warm buff below with minimal black streaks, which are normally confined to chest-sides. By their 2nd summer, the young eagles are still largely the same in colouring but tend to become more patchy below with increased heavy streaking. During the gradual further development through subsequent molts, the immature eagles develop a thicker subterminal band and a paler ground colour below. Among the bare parts, adult's eyes are yellow to yellow-orange while those of the juvenile are hazel-brown. Adult plumage is obtained between the 4th and 5th years. At all ages, the cere and feet are both pale yellow.</p><p>In flight, the Bonelli's eagle is a largish raptor with a well projecting head and fairly broad, long and rather square ended wings which are slightly pinched in at body with a little tapering at tips. Feather molts can make the wings look quite variable in shape with some individuals appearing rather longer and narrower winged than others. In flight, the tail appears fairly long and broad but if pinched in can appear surprisingly narrow. This species tends to fly with powerful but loose shallow beats. When gliding, they do so often on flat wings with well-spread feathers and the carpals pressed slightly forward but more so when entering a fast glide. This species soars infrequently on flat or slightly raised wings. At nearly all times of the year, Bonelli's eagles quite often flies in pairs. In colouring, the flying adult is dark above with a variable amount of the white marking on the mantle. The tail has faded barring (rarely perceptible) on grey with a big blotchy subterminal band and a white tip above. The markings on the tail look more or less the same when seen both from below and above. Adult Bonelli's eagles have white lesser coverts which along with the greyish tail stand out in contrast against blackish central wing band over the greater and median coverts. Also the flight feathers are faintly and thinly barred light grey-brown with paler bases, which often become paler (to a whitish hue) on the primaries inside blackish tips and leading wing coverts. In flight, juveniles are brown above with slightly darker wing ends and tips to greater coverts and greyer primary windows. Occasionally, juveniles manifest a creamy patch on back and obscure narrow U above barred tail, which even if present are only sometimes visible. Below the juvenile's wing linings are light rufous to warm buff like the body colour. Usually juveniles appear with darker tips to greater coverts forming wing-diagonals (sometimes lacking or confined to carpal area) and a small but distinct area of white on primaries against the blackish tips. Until the 3rd year, the young eagles appear more like a 1st year juvenile than an adult, but begin developing more streaks below and darker greater underwing coverts. By the 4th year, the subadult Bonelli's are increasingly similar to the adult, with an increasing subterminal band, a whiter underbody and fairly prominent underwing-diagonals. However, subadults are often still appear with a mix of paler barred juvenile type feathers and plainer darker adult feathers on the flight feathers.</p>\n\n<p>Bonelli's eagles are generally unmistakable when shape, flight and plumage are considered in combination. In poor light, it is possible to mistake one with a honey buzzard, one mainly in Europe and another mainly in Asia, as these raptors are extremely polymorphic and can come surprisingly close to approximating the plumage of various more powerful raptors. The wing shape in Bonelli's eagles can at times appear similar to that of honey buzzard but the latter raptor type are usually distinctly slimmer and slighter bodied with a much smaller, slimmer head. In flight, honey buzzards often have notched rather than square ended tails, less emarginated primaries and typically they fly with their wings held more at an angle. The sympatric species of honey buzzard tend to have bolder barring on the tail and underwings, broader dark trailing wing edges and all have no pale mantle patch or darker underwing-diagonals. An unlikely source of confusion is the northern goshawk (<i>Accipiter gentilis</i>), which is usually visibly smaller with much shorter wings, a slightly longer tail, different level flight style and many distinctive plumage characteristics. Distant juvenile Bonelli's could conceivably be mistaken for the long-legged buzzard (<i>Buteo rufinus</i>), but the buzzard is also smaller and is shorter tailed with prominent dark carpal patches and dark trailing wing edges. Furthermore, the buzzard usually holds its wings in a noticeable dihedral when flying in a soar. Adult Bonelli's eagles may be mistaken for pale morph adult booted eagle (<i>Hieraeetus pennatus</i>) by inexperienced observers but, beyond being a third larger and more than twice as heavy, Bonelli's eagles are rather distinct in plumage. Overall Bonelli's are much darker and streaker especially compared to the clearly paler flight feathers of booted eagles. Booted eagles are both whiter and more contrasting on the upperwing coverts, have whitish uppertail-coverts and have white on the wing's patagium. More similar in plumage is the juvenile Bonelli's eagle are the rare rufous morph of the booted eagle but the latter can still be told by the booted species\u2019 narrower wings and smaller size. In southern part of the Red Sea, vagrants (largely juveniles) may possibly come into range of the closely related and more similar African hawk-eagle, but the latter is comparatively short winged and longer tailed, with the adult plumage being more contrasting and juveniles being darker above with pale wing-windows.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Vocalizations\">Vocalizations</span></h3>\n\n<p>Bonelli's eagle is largely silent outside of breeding season and is a somewhat infrequent vocalizer even in the context of breeding. Its calls are less well studied than those of the African hawk-eagle, which although a tropical species, also generally ceases to call outside of the breeding season. The main call of the Bonelli's eagle is done during the courtship display and, sometimes, also at the nest. Its main call consists of a loud, shrill, somewhat far-carrying scream, <i>yuiii-yuiii-gii-gii</i> or a drawn-oout <i>heeeeii-heeeeii</i> with slight regional or even individual variations. Its call is farther carrying than the \u201cpuppy-like\u201d one of the golden eagle and is reminiscent in pitch of that of the red-tailed hawk (<i>Buteo jamaicensis</i>). The call may be given by both sexes. However, the female Bonelli's eagle calls most intensely when the male is delivering prey unlike the preference for vocalizing in aerial display as the male usually does. Other recorded vocalizations have included a fluted, low-pitched <i>klu-klu-klu</i> as well as a repeated <i>ki ki ki</i> in alarm. Also other barking, gurgling and grunting sounds have been reported by researchers at or near the nests.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Range_and_habitat\">Range and habitat</span></h2>\n\n<p>Bonelli's eagle have an extremely spotty and sparse worldwide distribution currently. The species is distributed in northwestern Africa from the Anti-Atlas in Morocco northeasterly through the lower parts of the Atlas mountains in northern Algeria and northern Tunisia (and probably formerly northern Libya). Beyond its African breeding range, the IUCN and others have mapped out a semi-regular wintering range for Bonelli's eagles, in coastal west Africa from southern Morocco down through Western Sahara, Mauritania and northwestern Senegal (rarely also east to Mali), although little more is reportedly known about this population and its origins. This is puzzling as the species is considered largely non-migratory. Additionally, the species has been recorded as a vagrant in east Africa in Somalia as well. In southern Europe, they range patchily through different parts of Portugal and Spain into southern France as far north as the department of Dr\u00f4me. Discontinuously, they are now seemingly solely left as breeding bird in Italy on the islands of Sardinia and Sicily. In southeastern Europe, an isolated population possibly persists in Croatia as well as in northern and southern Macedonia (with the further possibility of spilling over into Kosovo) and spottily through different areas of Greece (possibly spilling over the borders in the west in Albania and in the east in Bulgaria), as well as Crete. Out of Europe, they may be found in western and southern Turkey, Syria (possibly but most likely extirpated), the isle of Cyprus, Lebanon, Israel, western Jordan, northeastern Egypt (rarely in northern half of Sinai Peninsula) possibly but not certainly in spots in the west and south of Saudi Arabia and elsewhere in the Arabian Peninsula to Yemen, Oman and the United Arab Emirates. Elsewhere in the Middle East, their range includes eastern Iraq and west, south and northeastern Iran, extending somewhat into Turkmenistan in the Kopet Dag range.</p><p>Further east into Asia, their distribution includes eastern Afghanistan and Pakistan through most of the Indian subcontinent, where generally it is uncommon but more locally common near Nepal. On the other hand, they are absent in eastern India and only occurring as a vagrant to Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. In India, they are most regularly occur in certain area such as Chambal ravines, Ranthambore National Park, Chir zone of lower Kumaun Himalayas and in winter in the Keoladeo National Park of Bharatpur, Rajasthan. From central Myanmar they range across into northwestern Thailand and northern Laos (though possibly only as a visitor rather than breeding in the latter two). In southern China their resident range includes Yunnan, Guangxi and Guangdong north to Yangtze river as well as rarely into Hong Kong. Their isolated Indonesian population ranges is in the Lesser Sunda Islands, including at least Sumbawa, Timor, Wetar, Luang and Flores, however records show they've turned up on as many as 20 islands in the Lesser Sundas. Bonelli's eagles are mostly residential throughout their range but juvenile can disperse up to over several hundred kilometers. Sometimes, they are recorded at migration sites and at spots where not known to breed in winter. Wanderings include around 700\u00a0km (430\u00a0mi) north of their regular range in France near the coast of English Channel, far from their normal haunts in Regensburg, Germany and, probably both from the Italian island populations, to northwestern Italy and Slovenia. From their Iberian peninsula range presumably, vagrants have been reported in the Canary islands. Beyond Sri Lanka, other areas the species has been known to vagrate (or perhaps rarely winter) in Asia have included Kazakhstan, the Korean peninsula, Malaysia and Cochinchina in Vietnam, as well as a record in winter 1996 on the isle of Yamdena, the latter presumably from the Lesser Sunda population.</p><p>Bonelli's eagles across their wide range tend to dwell in fairly similar habitat types. They are mostly distributed in lands hugging large bodies of water, largely the Mediterranean Sea and northern Indian ocean. Also, to a lesser extent, they may live near the coast of the Atlantic and the Pacific as well as near the Caspian sea inland. Despite often being near seas and oceans they mostly occur in fairly arid habitats and in rather sunny areas. In some parts of Asia though semi-moist habitats may be resided in. Bonelli's eagles prefer rocky areas including lower mountains and foothills with plentiful cliffs, as well as steep sided river valleys and gorges. This species is very skilled at hunting in craggy, irregular rocky terrain. Usually, extensive garrigue-type habitat such as low bushes or more substantial vegetation such as scattered trees are a common feature of residential ranges but also at times even denser woodlands. Such scrubby areas are key since they generally hold prey concentration in Mediterranean habitats. However, excessive ground cover may limit hunting success so scrub is avoided when it becomes too dense. In the Mediterranean region, forests visited by Bonelli's eagles are usually either pine forests or sclerophyll forests. Deep forests are generally avoided, however. Although Carrascal &amp; Seoane (2009) claimed that agricultural areas are generally avoided per their analysis in Spain, Martinez-Miranzo et al. (2016) indicated that the species was showing a growing preference for agricultural arable land and other human-modified habitats, probably as prey selection has shifted more heavily to pigeons out of necessity. A similar growing preference for arables was also detected in Sicily as well. However, urban areas are generally strongly avoided both as breeding and as foraging areas by this species. Bonelli's eagles may additionally range into timbered plains or even virtually barren slopes or semi-desert, especially in areas such as Israel and India where moister valleys intersect with deserts. Juveniles may take up temporary residence over dry cultivation, small wetland areas, coastlines or surprisingly deep woodlands. In winter, these eagles may occur at times at lower elevation levels and more open habitats in semi-deserts and plains, where they can appear surprisingly at home, but often prefer wetter habitats such as large river mouths, marshlands and lakes, especially where these fall in existing home range, as prey is more likely to be concentrated in such areas. Usually Bonelli's eagles live at an elevation of 1,500\u00a0m (4,900\u00a0ft) or lower in Europe, to 2,000\u00a0m (6,600\u00a0ft) in their African Atlas mountain homes and to as high an elevation 3,000\u00a0m (9,800\u00a0ft) in Asia and even 3,750\u00a0m (12,300\u00a0ft) in residence in Bhutan. The main elevation where the species resides in the Himalayas falls between 1,200 and 2,000\u00a0m (3,900 and 6,600\u00a0ft).</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Behaviour_and_dietary_ecology\">Behaviour and dietary ecology</span></h2>\n\n<p>This species is very aerial, often given to soaring and circling over its home range. Like most raptorial birds, it mainly lives solitarily or in a breeding pair. The Bonelli's eagle is a powerful predator, and has been described as rather \u201cbold and rapacious\u201d. Its primary hunting methods recall those of a powerful <i>Accipiter</i> such as a goshawk. Most commonly, this eagle still-hunts, often either utilizing a concealed tree perch or a lofty spot in irregular rocky terrain to watch for prey activity. Upon spotting its quarry, it often dashes out rapidly to take birds as they take off or a mammal as it runs for cover, at times making lengthy tail-chase that may continue between trees or into tree stands or bushes. Not infrequently as a latter part of a tail chase, these eagles (again reminiscent of a goshawk) will occasionally walk on the ground to obtain their prey. Bonelli's eagles also hunt in a quartering flying style relatively close to the ground (in a fashion reminiscent of a harrier) or patrols hillsides for prey activity. Bonelli's eagles will also occasionally stoop from a soaring height onto prey. Mostly, this predator takes birds from on or near the ground but some snatched them from bushes and, seldomly, water. It has been known to have sufficient agility to catch some birds from active flight. In one case, a Bonelli's eagle was observed to fly below a jackdaw and swoop upwards to grab it from below. Tandem hunting by a lifelong pair is quite common, almost exceptionally so in this species. One eagle tends to fly directly above the other, with several cases of one eagle scattering a bird flock for the other eagle to quickly single out, in a similar style to tandem-hunting laggar falcons (<i>Falco jugger</i>). However, per Spanish studies, apparently tandem hunting neither improved hunting success nor were the eagles able to capture larger prey (in fact the estimated prey size by pairs was slightly lower than that taken by each mate hunting by itself) while hunting in tandem. It was hypothesized that tandem hunting is more important to the socio-sexual relations of the pair rather than capture of a significant amount of prey. Compared to most other booted eagles, Bonelli's eagle takes a great majority of its prey alive and seldom comes to carrion or pirates foods from other raptors. However, it will readily come to previously injured prey, especially water birds shot by duck hunters, and will readily take young animals across most prey classes. Also, in Keoladeo National Park, India, Bonelli's eagles were observed to habitually follow harriers, spotted eagles and other <i>Aquila</i> eagles in order to capture water birds incidentally flushed during their flybys.</p>\n\n<p>Overall, Bonelli's eagles take a fairly wide variety of prey. Across its wide range, their prey spectrum has been known to include perhaps up to nearly 200 prey species. Dietary studies have primarily been conducted in western Europe, though some study has gone into their food habits elsewhere (being fairly well known in Cyprus and, less so, India). Brown &amp; Amadon (1986) considered the Bonelli's eagles prey size range as nearly as extensive as the most massive booted eagles, such as the golden eagle and the martial eagle (<i>Polemaetus bellicosus</i>) (but mainly may have been describing the  African hawk-eagle that was lumped at the time). Bonelli's eagles mainly hunts birds and mammals, taking reptiles and other prey types on a more local and sporadic basis. In western Europe, it is considered something of a specialist predator on rabbits and partridges, though other birds such as pigeons, gulls and corvids sometimes are taken as much or more so depending on local prey population trends. Pellet analysis is considered the most reliable way to get a complete picture of Bonelli's eagle dietary habits. Despite its predaceous power, typically the average size of prey taken are within average range for a raptorial bird and it may take smaller prey on average than its mildly smaller cousin, the African hawk-eagle. In Sierra Morena, Spain, the mean size of prey taken was estimated at 630\u00a0g (1.39\u00a0lb), while in Greece the mean prey size was estimated at 877\u00a0g (1.933\u00a0lb). A subsequent study in Spain, however, posited the mean prey size as lower than in the past, stating that prey taken by males averaged an estimated 416\u00a0g (14.7\u00a0oz) and by females at 459\u00a0g (1.012\u00a0lb), probably due to increased importance of pigeons and reduced numbers of rabbits. Thus, on average, prey sizes average about 20-45% of the Bonelli's eagles own weight. Furthermore, the latter Spanish study found hunting success of Bonelli's eagles to average around 28.5%, a slightly higher hunting success rate than golden eagles (20%) or lesser spotted eagles (<i>Clanga pomarina</i>) (24%) but slightly lower than greater spotted eagles (<i>Clanga clanga</i>) (34%).</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Rabbits_and_other_lagomorphs\">Rabbits and other lagomorphs</span></h3>\n\n<p>More than any other, the European rabbit (<i>Oryctolagus cuniculus</i>) is considered the most important prey species for most European Bonelli's eagles. In the largest European studies, the rabbit is usually the leading prey species: such as in Catalonia, Spain where rabbits comprised 22.54% of 2254 prey items (and 33.3%  of the prey biomass) and in Provence, France where rabbits made up 16.4% of 2742 prey items. In the third largest western European study, rabbits were secondary in number to pigeons (at 18.4% of 1641 prey items) but were still the largest contributors of biomass, at 33.2%. Even where non-native, such as the Aegean islands of Greece, the European rabbit dominated the foods of this eagle, comprising 40.8% by number and 46.6% by biomass of the foods. In Spain, it was found that about three-quarters of studied floating juvenile Bonelli's eagles were hunting rabbits almost exclusively, apparently as they were easier to capture despite their larger size than bird prey. Research determines that Bonelli's eagle are often attracted to scrub areas during hunting forays to catch sight of rabbits foraying out of vegetative cover. Since young juvenile and yearling rabbits are forced out to more open feeding spots by dominant adult rabbits, they are disproportionately often selected by Bonelli's eagles and other avian predators. Rabbits become more commonly caught during the summer when the young rabbits tend to disperse. On the contrary, 86.2% of the rabbits taken in southwest Portugal were reportedly adults. Most rabbits caught by Bonelli's eagle were estimated to weigh between 500 and 1,500\u00a0g (1.1 and 3.3\u00a0lb) (from the size of a kit to a smallish adult) per Spanish studies, with an estimated average weight in Spain of 857\u00a0g (1.889\u00a0lb). A study in southeastern Spain estimated that the region's Bonelli's eagles claim about 337 rabbits during the breeding season and 237 rabbits during non-breeding during the course of a year, so despite their heavy predation barely make a dent on the overall population of rabbits (effecting less than 2.5% of the population at peak). The native western European population of wild rabbit has been heavily depleted by myxomatosis and rabbit haemorrhagic disease, having been reduced by an estimated 50-70%. While the overall numbers seemingly taken by them reduced by as much as a third between 1968 and 2009, on evidence Bonelli's eagle still sought them out and hunted rabbits preferentially even during the non-breeding season when their numbers dip to their lowest. In additional, fairly significant numbers of other lagomorphs may be taken, extending to occasional Granada hares (<i>Lepus granatensis</i>) as well as accounts of Bonelli's eagles hunting European hares (<i>Lepus europaeus</i>) in the Greek isles and Indian hares (<i>Lepus nigricollis</i>) in the lower Himalayas.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Gamebirds_and_pigeons\">Gamebirds and pigeons</span></h3>\n\n<p>The main secondary wild prey species associated with Bonelli's eagles is the red-legged partridge (<i>Alectoris rufa</i>). Although at times capable of evading the attentions of eagles, this partridge occurs in conveys in the same mixed scrub that hold rabbits and is taken whenever the eagles are lucky enough to have the element of surprise. About 383 red-legged partridges were estimated to be hunted annually in one study area of southwestern Spain. In the large Spanish study of Catalonia, French study of Provence and in southwest Portugal, the red-legged partridge made up 9.57%, 11.6% and 17.2% of the diet by number, respectively. More so than any other prey type outside of western Europe, gamebirds such as partridges seem to be globally the most favored prey type where available for Bonelli's eagle. In Cyprus, a review of 528 prey items, revealed that the chukar (<i>Alectoris chukar</i>) was the main prey at 31.4% of the diet. More than a dozen gamebirds have been detected in the foods of this species from Asia with at least a half dozen genera turning up in a few reviews of their ecology in India. At times, even adult Indian peafowl (<i>Pavo cristatus</i>), potentially weighing up to 6\u00a0kg (13\u00a0lb), have been dispatched by this species. In the Lesser Sunda Islands, most eye-witness accounts of their hunting habits indicate that wild (or, on some islands, introduced) green junglefowl (<i>Gallus varius</i>) as well as village chickens (<i>Gallus gallus</i>) are likely to be the most important prey. Beyond  gamebirds, pigeons are the other most significant avian prey type. The two larger European pigeons, the oft feral or domestic rock pigeon (<i>Columba livia</i>) and the common wood pigeon (<i>Columba palumbus</i>), are almost solely favored among this group where encountered. In southwest Portugal, pigeons have surpassed rabbits (due to their disease-based decline) to become the most important prey. Here, attempts were made to parse the proportion of feral pigeons that were taken against the number of domestic pigeons (since pigeon fanciers frequently persecute this eagle due its allegedly heavily predation of domestic birds). Of the 1497 prey items overall, feral pigeons were found to comprise 30.1% of the food by number and 26% of the biomass while the domestic types made up only 9.7% of the diet by number and 7.2% of the biomass. In Catalonia, Spain, unidentified pigeons made up 17.8% of the foods and 17.4% of the biomass while identified common wood pigeons made up a further 6.24% of the number and 6.54% of the biomass, while a smaller study from the same area boosted wood pigeons to make up 11.3% of 524 prey items. In Cyprus, rock and common wood pigeons collectively made up 27.7% of the diet.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Other_birds\">Other birds</span></h3>\n\n<p>Other medium-sized birds are taken widely by Bonelli's eagles. A surprisingly popular dietary choice in western Europe was for yellow-legged gulls (<i>Larus michahellis</i>), weighing an estimated 1,119\u00a0g (2.467\u00a0lb). In the 2724 prey items in Provence, France this gull was second only to the rabbit in number, comprising 14.6% of the diet. Other gulls are readily taken by Bonelli's eagles as well as wide diversity of other water birds, including rails, stone curlews, lapwings, sandpipers, tubenoses, cormorants and herons. Water birds taken Bonelli's eagles may vary in size from wading birds as small as 48\u00a0g (1.7\u00a0oz) common sandpiper (<i>Acitis hypoleucos</i>) and diving birds as small as 174\u00a0g (6.1\u00a0oz) little grebes (<i>Tachybaptus ruficollis</i>) to those as large as adults of 3.18\u00a0kg (7.0\u00a0lb) painted storks (<i>Ciconia leucocephala</i>), 3.31\u00a0kg (7.3\u00a0lb) greylag goose (<i>Anser anser</i>) (though reportedly taken while injured by buckshot in India), and 5.5\u00a0kg (12\u00a0lb) common crane (<i>Grus grus</i>). Corvids, of a dozen or more species and up to the size of the 1.1\u00a0kg (2.4\u00a0lb) common raven (<i>Corvus corax</i>), are taken in considerable numbers in differing parts of the range. In Provence, France Eurasian magpie (<i>Pica pica</i>) and western jackdaw (<i>Corvus monedula</i>) made up 10.17% and 9.95% of the diet respectively. In Portugal, Eurasian jay comprised 7.5% by number but only 2.7% of the biomass. Corvids were the leading prey for Bonelli's eagles in Georgia, with the Eurasian magpie comprising 12.3% of the diet (though largely young were reportedly taken) and carrion crows (<i>Corvus corone</i>) making up a further 10.76%. In the Aegeans of Greece carrion crows comprised 14.1% of the prey by number and 8.8% of the biomass, while south of Turkey in Cyprus, western jackdaw comprised 7.6% of the foods. Other assorted avian prey groups taken in usually smaller numbers include cuckoos, swifts, bustards, nightjars, bee-eaters, rollers, hoopoes. woodpeckers and parrots. Among passerines, which are usually quite secondary besides corvids, they've been known to hunt various larks (up to nearly 11% of the diet in Georgia), shrikes, swallows, accentors, Old World flycatchers (at least 10 different species), thrushes, pipits, starlings, buntings, finches and Old world sparrows. In total, some 130 bird species may be taken and birds as a whole almost always form the most ample part of the diet compared to other classes: 69.5% and 80.97% of the biomass in the south of France, 67.7% in Georgia and 62.6% in Catalonia, Spain.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Other_assorted_prey\">Other assorted prey</span></h3>\n<p>Beyond the high significance of rabbits (and sometimes other lagomorphs), other mammals are rarely as important or diverse in the diet of Bonelli's eagles as birds are. A couple of rodents can be locally significant secondary prey, however. The red squirrel (<i>Sciurus vulgaris</i>), with a mean estimated mass in Spain of 241\u00a0g (8.5\u00a0oz), was reported in almost all western Europe studies, with about 130 reported as taken in studies from Provence, France. The black rat (<i>Rattus rattus</i>), of similar size to the squirrel at an average of about 200\u00a0g (7.1\u00a0oz) was an important secondary food source in islands south and east of Greece, being the second most common prey species in Cyprus (15.5% of 528 prey items) and fifth most important prey species in the Aegean islands. In northwestern Africa such as Morocco, it was reported that the fat sand rat (<i>Psammomys obesus</i>), another rodent of roughly similar size, was amongst the favorite foods locally for Bonelli's eagles. Other rodent species known in the diet of Bonelli's eagles have included other squirrels, gundis, assorted mice, voles, dormice and blind mole rats. Beyond a few species of hedgehogs, additional mammalian prey for this species, although seldom taken, can be relatively large. They've been known to attack the young of various ungulates include blackbuck (<i>Antilope cervicapra</i>), chinkara (<i>Gazella bennettii</i>), domestic goats (<i>Capra aegagrus hircus</i>) and domestic sheep (<i>Ovis aries</i>). In the Aegean islands, live-caught but often young and small goat kids comprised 8.5% of the foods and 24.3% of the biomass at nests. Among carnivorans, Bonelli's eagles have reportedly attacked red fox (<i>Vulpes vulpes</i>) and wildcats (<i>Felis silvestris</i>) (probably mostly kits and kittens of these two species) in western Europe as well as stone martens (<i>Martes foina</i>) and assorted weasels. Meanwhile, adult Bengal fox (<i>Vulpes bengalensis</i>) have reportedly been caught in India. In France and Spain, mammals overall comprised 34.8% and 26.1% of the diet, respectively, whereas in Georgia they made up 15.4% of the  diet. Reptiles are usually secondary prey throughout the range. Though they are known to hunt snakes, Bonelli's eagles rarely hunt them and generally seem to pursue lizards by preference. In Cyprus, starred agamas (<i>Stellagama stellio</i>) comprised 5.9% of the food, unidentified <i>Lacerta</i> lizards 10.76% of diet in Georgia (and reptiles altogether adding up to 16.9% of the food by number), and ocellated lizard (<i>Timon lepidus</i>), at 228\u00a0g (8.0\u00a0oz) in mean body mass, 3.97% biomass and 7.05% by number in Catalonia, Spain. Desert monitor (<i>Varanus griseus</i>) and probably assorted other monitor lizards were reportedly amongst the leading prey for Bonelli's eagles in several parts of India. Minor prey includes toads and possibly a few other types of amphibian. Potentially insects and/or other invertebrates may be taken but these may incidentally consumed (i.e. undigested food from the stomachs of prey).</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Interspecies_predatory_relationships\">Interspecies predatory relationships</span></h3>\n\n<p>Bonelli's eagles frequently occur in range with multiple other eagles and competing predators. Almost certainly the most direct competitor from their European range to the Middle East is their much larger cousin, the golden eagle. Habitat preferences overlap between these two eagles with both species favoring rocky habitats, though the golden eagle regularly dwells at slightly higher elevations with alpine meadows (though is as adaptive to low elevations as the Bonelli's so long as habitat is favorable and undisturbed). Competition between the eagles has been reported in particular from Spain, in areas such as Sierra Morena. Both species excluded each other from mutual territories and had broadly overlapping food habits. However, the Bonelli's eagle took more birds and golden eagle more singularly hunted rabbits. Mean distance between nests on a plot of 2,200\u00a0km<sup>2</sup> (850\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) was found to be 10.2\u00a0km (6.3\u00a0mi) for 8 pairs of golden eagles and 11.4\u00a0km (7.1\u00a0mi) for 10 pairs of Bonelli's.  The two can co-exist with sufficiently large ranges as long as they are able to maintain their own range, with the existence of trophic segregation (by size and the more avian based diet of the Bonelli's) and the lag in the breeding periods, as these natural mechanisms would allow the coexistence of both species in the mountain. Cases of golden eagles taking over prior Bonelli's eagles territories have been reported but usually golden eagles only takes up the prior Bonelli's territory when the latter vanishes due to unrelated (often anthropogenic) causes not direct competition or usurpation. A minor negative effect has been probably correlated with golden eagles not infrequently attacking and displacing juvenile and subadult Bonelli's eagles and can tend to be behaviorally dominant in keeping with its larger size. This in turn presumably hampers the ability of the Bonelli's to expand their range after declines and stabilize their population. Further east, in Israel, Bonelli's and golden eagles are competitors as well. In the dry, barren Negev desert, golden eagles nests were found 13.1\u00a0km (8.1\u00a0mi) apart and Bonelli's were scarce. In the Judean desert, which has more annual rainfall and more available prey, the distance between golden eagle nests averaged 16\u00a0km (9.9\u00a0mi) and the Bonelli's eagle easily outnumbered them. Apparently, the Bonelli's eagle exceptionally outcompeted its larger cousin here due to a subtle topographic variation in the habitat. In Spain, Bonelli's eagles share cliff habitats beyond golden eagles also with peregrine falcons (<i>Falco peregrinus</i>), common ravens, Eurasian eagle-owls (<i>Bubo bubo</i>) and three species of vulture. The eagles tend to dominate the smaller carnivorous birds in most circumstances, even the swifter peregrine. However, the still larger griffon vulture (<i>Gyps fulvus</i>) was apparently a routine territory and nest usurper of other birds of prey, displacing golden eagles, bearded vultures (<i>Gypaetus barbatus</i>) and Egyptian vultures (<i>Neophron percnopterus</i>) from their nests as well as 9 out of 23 eyries built by Bonelli's eagles in the study area. Despite their prior claimed \u201cdominance\u201d over the swift falcons, at least three cases have been observed of peregrine falcons usurping Bonelli's eagle (presumably through routine harassment and dive-bombing) nests in Spain. Beyond golden eagles, peregrines and griffon vultures, tawny owls (<i>Strix alucco</i>) have been known to take over old Bonelli's eagle nests.</p><p>European rabbits have a huge range of predators in the Iberian peninsula, with at least 30 different species known to hunt the once densely-populated lagomorph. Besides the overlapping ranges of the Bonelli's and golden eagles, most other birds of prey that hunt rabbits extensively are partitioned from the potential depletive effect of competition by differences in habitat preferences, hunting techniques and temporal activity. Beyond the specialized mammalian predator, the Iberian lynx (<i>Lynx pardinus</i>), some of the other most specialized predators of wild rabbits are Bonelli's eagles, golden eagles, Spanish imperial eagles (<i>Aquila adalberti</i>) and Eurasian eagle-owls. A comparative study indicated that the golden eagle diet was comprised 40% by rabbits, while they made up 49% for eagle-owls, 50% for Spanish imperial eagles and 61% for Bonelli's eagle. Elsewhere, higher import has been applied for rabbits in the local diet of golden eagles as well as for Spanish imperial eagles. The mean size of rabbits taken increases more or less with the size of the avian predator: 662\u00a0g (1.459\u00a0lb) for northern goshawks, 857\u00a0g (1.889\u00a0lb) for Bonelli's eagles, 1,000\u00a0g (2.2\u00a0lb) for Eurasian eagle-owls and 1,360\u00a0g (3.00\u00a0lb) for golden eagles.</p><p>Along with northern goshawks, golden eagles and Eurasian eagle-owls, Bonelli's eagle is considered a \u201csuper predator\u201d in the European region due to its habit of hunting other predators. In contrast to the other birds of prey, they are somewhat less commonly at high predator status compared to goshawks (most common predator of other diurnal raptors in studies), golden eagles (most common predator of mesopredator mammals), and eagle-owl (most common predator of other owls). However, they are fairly common predators of other diurnal birds of prey, per overall analysis they took such prey somewhat more regularly than did golden eagles in Europe. Among the other accipitrids that the Bonelli's eagle have been known to hunt include the Indian spotted eagle (<i>Clanga hastata</i>), European honey buzzard (<i>Pernis apivorus</i>), red kite (<i>Milvus milvus</i>), black kite (<i>Milvus migrans</i>), western marsh harrier (<i>Circus aeruginosus</i>), Montagu's harrier (<i>Circus pygargus</i>), hen harrier (<i>Circus cyaenus</i>), Eurasian sparrowhawk (<i>Accipiter nisus</i>), shikra (<i>Accipiter badius</i>), northern goshawk, long-legged buzzard and common buzzard (<i>Buteo buteo</i>). Among falcons, they've been known to prey upon common kestrel (<i>Falco tinnunculus</i>), lesser kestrel (<i>Falco naumanni</i>) and peregrine falcon and as for owls, tawny owl (<i>Strix alucco</i>), little owl (<i>Athene noctua</i>), long-eared owl (<i>Asio otus</i>), short-eared owl (<i>Asio flammeus</i>) and most impressively of all, in at least one instance, an adult Eurasian eagle-owl. Although usually classed as an apex predator, as in most cases of apex predators in competitive environments, Bonelli's eagles sometimes infrequently fall victim to interspecific killings and predation as well. Eurasian eagle-owls have been known to prey on Bonelli's nestlings a few times and possibly also an adult at least once. In one case, a subadult male golden eagle preyed upon an adult male Bonelli's eagle. Stone martens are also counted amongst the predators of nests (exclusively as egg thieves) in Spain.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Breeding\">Breeding</span></h2>\n\n<p>Bonelli's eagles, like most but not all raptorial birds, generally lives solitarily or in pairs. They usually mate for life. Territories are maintained through aerial displays which often involve calling, single or mutual high circling and, most frequently, sky-dancing in the area of eyrie. During this species\u2019 sky-dances, one or other of the eagle pair plunges headlong from a great height, with its wings almost closed, before checking and rising again on stiff wings, circling to regain original altitude and diving again. The sky-dance sequence may be repeated up to 5-10 times. Occasionally but usually infrequently, territorial exclusions escalate into talon grappling between a territorial bird and an intruder. Aerial display extend with diminished frequency into the incubation and early nestling periods. In Spain, the average estimated size of a pairs home range was a very large 44.2\u00a0km<sup>2</sup> (17.1\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), though only 27.3% of their home ranges on average were used in all seasons. Home ranges in Portugal were estimated to average up to 130\u00a0km<sup>2</sup> (50\u00a0sq\u00a0mi). On Cyprus, the mean nearest neighbor distance was 7.4\u00a0km (4.6\u00a0mi) with 0.52-0.65 pairs per 100\u00a0km<sup>2</sup> (39\u00a0sq\u00a0mi). Contrary to many other raptor species,  it was found that were no significant relationship between the density of their main prey species and the distance of the neighbouring pairs. A dead or missing mate may be quickly replaced and mature adults have additionally been seen breeding with subadults.</p>\n\n<p>The breeding season of Bonelli's eagles is from late January/February to July in the western part of the range and November\u2013August/September (peaking December\u2013May) in the Indian subcontinent and Myanmar. Both members of the pair may dwell around the eyrie for up to 2\u20133 months before breeding. Their nest is a huge structure of branches and sticks, scarcely smaller than those built by eagles twice the size of this species, though rarely as great in depth as some old nests of the larger eagles. Often the nest completely obscures the sitting female from view unless it is seen at the same level or higher than the nest. Nest size can average up to 1.8\u00a0m (5.9\u00a0ft) across and 60\u00a0cm (24\u00a0in) deep but with repeated use the nest can range up to 2\u00a0m (6.6\u00a0ft) in both directions (record sized nest in India was 2.4\u00a0m (7.9\u00a0ft) in height). Tree nests tend to average larger than those placed on cliff ledges. One nest in the Gir forest was used periodically used over the course of 30 years. While they may line their active nest with greenery, it is less frequent and sparser where present than in many other birds of prey. Nesting locales are often high on cliff ledge or at 5 to 40\u00a0m (16 to 131\u00a0ft) (usually over 10\u00a0m (33\u00a0ft)) above the ground in large tree. Very rarely, nests may too be on the perimeter of buildings. The trees selected are often the tallest and/or most densely foliaged in a given stand. Their close cousin, the African hawk-eagle, usually nests on trees and rarely utilizes crags and alternate nesting sites as does the Bonelli's. Historically, throughout their range in western Europe, Bonelli's eagles were considered almost obligate cliff nesters on almost any rocky environment, from precipitous mountain ranges, canyons over river valleys, even down to low rocky rubble to sea cliffs. However, up to 52 tree nests for the species have now been recorded in southwest Portugal. Often the Portuguese nesting eagles used invasive Tasmanian blue gum (<i>Eucalyptus globulus</i>) (44.2% of the time) while a further 21.2% were on cork oak (<i>Quercus suber</i>)  not to mention some that were placed on large shrubs, i.e. strawberry trees (<i>Arbutus unedo</i>). The mean height of Portuguese tree nest was 23.9\u00a0m (78\u00a0ft). The Portuguese study further found 67.3% of the tree nests to be on hill slopes and 4.5\u00a0m (15\u00a0ft) average height for lowest branch, both presumably as anti-predator measure. By 2017, the expansion to using tree nests had bolstered the southwest Portugal population considerably. In the 1990s, the first ever tree nest was found in the relative Bonelli's eagle stronghold of Catalonia, Spain, while another singular tree nest was also found in the south of France. In India, Bonelli's eagles seem to readily switch between tree and cliff nests. The eagles of areas such as Maharashtra and the Western Ghats are usually partial to nesting in trees while in the Deccan Peninsula, Indo-Gangetic plain and Himalayan foothills, the eagles alternated between nesting on cliffs and lofty trees including red silk cotton (<i>Bombax ceiba</i>), sacred fig (<i>Ficus religiosa</i>), Javan plum (<i>Syzygium cumini</i>) or <i>Dalbergia ssp</i>. Bonelli's eagles in India may also nest close to human habitations if disturbance is low, such as in Saurashtra and in Himalayan foothills, in the latter often in large chir pine (<i>Pinus roxburghii</i>) near villages. In Pakistan, the species has been known to use seaside cliffs. Also, in the Indian desert zone, Bonelli's eagles are known to use relatively low rocky hills with shallow gradients, making the nest ledges relatively easy to access. On Cyprus, 70% of nests were in Turkish pines (<i>Pinus brutia</i>) at a mean elevation of 625\u00a0m (2,051\u00a0ft). Often this eagle uses the same nest in successive years but also alternate nest may be used. Often somewhere between 1 and 5 nests may be built by the species on their home range. Like other birds of prey, the presence of alternate nest may be a strategy to cope with ectoparasitic infestations within the nest. The construction of a new nest takes roughly a month's time.</p>\n\n\n<p>The clutch size is usually 2, though one egg is not infrequently laid. This species seldom lays three eggs, though there are now a few records of this and even three large eaglets recorded in a nest. Their eggs are largely white but are often sparingly spotted and streaked with brown. In a sample of 120, egg height was measured as 62 to 76.5\u00a0mm (2.44 to 3.01\u00a0in), with an average of 69\u00a0mm (2.7\u00a0in) by 48 to 57.3\u00a0mm (1.89 to 2.26\u00a0in) in diameter, with an average of 54\u00a0mm (2.1\u00a0in). Egg laying dates peak from February to April in France, January in North Africa while in India, the peak may be December to April, sometimes even into May (as in the Himalayas). Incubation lasts for 37 to 41 days in Europe but is estimated at a more prolonged 40\u201345 days in the more tropical Indian subcontinent. Incubation is mainly done by the female (about 90% of the time) while males mainly capture food. Upon hatching, the eaglets are altricial initially. The first feathers start appearing through the white down at 25\u201335 days and practically cover the body by 45 days. By the latter stage, the eaglets can normally feed themselves but may be variable in learning ability. Fledgling period is at 56 to 65 days of age (rarely as late as 70 days). The average age at fledging in Spain was estimated at 63 days. Female broods about 90% of the time for first two weeks after first hatching but this decreases to 50% by the end of those weeks. The female attacks potential predators that come near the nest including other raptors. In the Indian subcontinent, they've been seen to escort oriental honey buzzards, crested serpent eagles (<i>Spilornis cheela</i>), bearded vultures, as well as <i>Gyps</i> vultures, conspecifics and corvids away from the eyrie vicinity while the presence of  northern plains gray langurs (<i>Semnopithecus entellus</i>) was observed to provoke a fierce defensive attack. However, unlike African hawk-eagles, Bonelli's eagles rarely attack humans at the nest. Males at times have been observed to take a share of the brooding and rarely even feeding the eaglet(s). Caches of food are often stored early on but are quickly depleted and rarely still present latter in the nesting period when the eaglets growth accelerates. The female lingers near nest even after brooding stage. However, the female also tends to take part in prey capture relatively early in fledging period compared to many other eagles. In the latter third of the post-fledging period, the parents are rarely in attendance except when bringing food. The dependence of the young eagles may extend for about 8 to 11 weeks, but has individually varied from 50 to over 120 days. Research on conditions and habitat composition has indicated variation in the post-fledgling dependence stage is derived from habitat quality or from parental skill. However, fledgling body condition seemed to play no major role in this stage. On evidence, the young eagles drift from their parents care independently.</p>\n\n<p>One of the most significant portions of the Bonelli's eagles lifecycle is the dispersal stage. The dispersal and post-dispersal stage has been studied at length in western Europe, with a surprising amount of individual variation being found. Here, dispersal occurred at an average age of 142 days (occasionally up to 163 days old) with a varying distance of dispersal from nest to settlement area were from 50 to 536\u00a0km (31 to 333\u00a0mi). The average distance of dispersal in France was 158\u00a0km (98\u00a0mi). Anywhere from 58% of 47 to 87% of 7 juveniles survived per these radio-tagged studies. The high distance dispersal of the juvenile Bonelli's eagles may potentially benefit gene flow. At least 20 communal roosts for post-dispersal juvenile Bonelli's eagles were found in Spain. Each were found to house between 2 and 11 eagles of the species, with mean of 5.1. It was also found the juveniles were usually sharing many of the roosts with Spanish imperial eagle juveniles as well (in 91.4% of roost) though each species clustered separately in different parts of the trees or bushes. More infrequently, assorted other species of raptor would join the juvenile eagle roosts at dusk.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Breeding_success_and_causes_of_failures\">Breeding success and causes of failures</span></h3>\n\n<p>The breeding success of Bonelli's eagles may vary considerably. Mean fledgling success on Cyprus was found to be 1.44 per pair. In Sicily, breeding success was found to vary 0.67 (in the 1990s) to 1.37 (in the 2000s after some protection) and productivity of successful pairs was from 1.42 (2000s) to 1.51 (1990s). Of 1506 breeding attempts in western Europe, 65.7% were successful. Of these successful ones, 39.8% produced one fledgling, 59.7% produced two and only 0.5% produced three fledglings. Like many birds of prey, siblicide or cainism has occurred, wherein the eldest nestling repeatedly attacks, often killing and occasionally eating their younger siblings. In about 20% of nest, the second chick survives, therefore this species is classed as a facultative cainist rather than an obligate one. On evidence, egg laying and hatching may grow more asynchronous when frequently interrelated outside stressors such as food supply, habitat disturbance and poor weather are applied, all of which may increase the likelihood of cainism. Whether the young have died by siblicide or via other means, Bonelli's eagles have been known to consume their own dead nestlings on a couple of occasions. On evidence, the younger eaglets of Bonelli's eagles and other species in areas where threatened may too survive by human intervention, wherein they remove the chicks and either raise them in semi-captivity or introduce them to a new set of parents. In India, habitat and the resulting prey composition were found to be the most significant drivers of breeding success. In protected areas such as Ranthambore National Park, nest often produce two fledglings, while in degraded areas such as the Kumaun division, they often produce just one. Fledgling number here was thought to be driven primarily by prey carrying capacity of a given area. When an almost fledged young was stolen by village children in India, 15 hours later, researchers introduced another which was accepted by parents. In a similar case, another Indian pair rejected its own nearly fledged eaglet after it had been stolen, however with repeated attempts was accepted and successfully fledged. When poachers stole some eagles in Spain, a couple of pairs were found to successfully lay replacement clutches (each with the typical 2 eggs) some 25\u201330 days later. A western European review of 1052 breeding attempts indicated a negative correlation with colder temperatures and heavier rains during nesting. Therefore, in more temperate areas such as northern Spain, the average breeding success was lower and the young often dispersed southwards due to the cooler climate.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Conservation_and_rehabilitation\">Conservation and rehabilitation</span></h2>\n\n<p>Bonelli's eagles have sharply decline, at least locally inexorably and drastically, in much of their range. In the 1990s, it was estimated that the entire west Palearctic held about 2000-3000 pairs with the Iberian peninsula (750-845 pairs) and northwestern Africa (1000 or so) being the core areas. In the mid-1990s, it was indicated that there were 938-1039 pairs in all of Europe, about 75-80% of which in Spain with an estimated 75-90 in Portugal, 35-45 in Greece, 29 in France, 15-20 in Italy, and a handful each in Croatia and Albania. By the 2000s, with some continued declines and minor local recoveries (as well as more comprehensive surveying) resulted in an estimate of 1500 pairs in Europe, still far less than historic numbers (at least a 30% reduction since the 1950s) and qualifying the species for local critically endangered status. Local extinction is probable in many if not all populations yet there is no overarching action plan for conserving the species. On evidence, populations in core protected areas have increased but fringe areas, important especially to vagrant juveniles, continue to show strong declines and high mortality rates. Although listed today by the IUCN as breeding species there, the Bonelli's eagle may be extinct as a nesting species in Bosnia and Herzegovina. As of 2010, 20 to 22 breeding territories have been found in Sicily and it was thought that this population holds about 95% of the remaining Italian population. Sicilian eagles per study were shown to have high adult mortality (10.2%) and at least 17 pairs in 2010 failed to breed altogether. In their Spanish stronghold, the species has declined or disappeared in 27 out of 40 provinces since 1980, with over 20% reduction in north and central parts. The coastal sierras of east and south Iberia hold highest European densities at 1 pair per 100\u2013200\u00a0km<sup>2</sup> (39\u201377\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), but once formerly it held a pair per 60\u00a0km<sup>2</sup> (23\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) in the 1970s. In the Region of Murcia, Spain, the Bonelli's eagle was considered the second most threatened raptor species, behind only the lesser kestrel. In the Province of Burgos in northern Spain the number of pairs reduced from 25-27 to 10 between 1980 and 1996. Of 100 breeding attempts from 1988 to 1996, only 0.3 were successful and average success rate was only 0.35, despite surplus feeding beginning after 1992. From 200 or more pairs in Greece in the early 1980s, the population has fallen to less than 50. What was roughly estimated to be about 50 pairs (estimated earlier at up to 100), in Turkey in the late 1980s to the 1990s, has recently been revised based on research to only 20-35 pairs in isolated small pockets. In Israel, 28 pairs of Bonelli's eagle were known to be present in 1989 but little information has been obtained from the rest of Middle East and from Asia. Israeli populations have been roughly halved in size. By 2001, only 15 pairs were known to breed in Israel. Besides the four species that have become locally extinct in Israel, it is likely that the Bonelli's eagle is the most endangered Israeli raptor. It was estimated that the maximum number in Asia is likely around 35,000 pairs but it could be well less than half of that. Perhaps the only factor preventing authorities such as the IUCN from uplisting Bonelli's eagle to a more severe status is due to lack of extensive research on their population in the Asian range. Strong declines in Asia may be occurring as well. A bird survey of a large area of Uttarakhand, India where the species was historically present failed to find any signs of remaining Bonelli's eagles. In Gujarat, India, an analysis from the 1990s determined that the species was increasingly scarce due to human disturbance and logging. Very little information is known about the current status of  Bonelli's eagles in northern Africa (with the last survey known of the species in Morocco dating to the mid-1980s), although the trends seen in western Europe may be roughly reflected there as well.</p><p>In multiple parts of the range, certainly in western Europe as well as Cyprus, Bonelli's eagles face a high degree of persecution by hunters, gamekeepers and pigeon-fanciers. Shooting and poisoning of this species persist extensively into the 21st century. Habitat alteration and destruction (e.g. development of roads, intensified agriculture, irrigation of dry fields) in addition to reduced prey numbers and human disturbance in the nesting area are ongoing and increasing threats everywhere for this eagle. Even human activity such as large quantities of people on holiday has been shown to have a negative effect on this eagle as they may alter their range to avoid such activity. From 1990 to 1996, 424 dead Bonelli's eagles in Spain were recorded, 55% died due to electrocution and 26% due to poisoning and shooting. Adults were mainly killed via persecution whereas most juveniles died by electrocution. In Catalonia and central Spain, 50% and 86% due to electrocution whereas persecution was more major in Levante and northern Spain (accounting for 52% and 43% of deaths). Abandonment of territories could not be correlated to interspecific competition but was linked to human influence and persecution. In Sicily, the main threats are thought to be habitat fragmentation and intensifying agriculture. Previously egg-collectors were semi-regularly exacerbating the reduction of the species on Sicily, but this behaviour has seemingly declined mercifully in recent years. Given its relative scarcity in Crete, only a small number of Bonelli's eagles were recovered dead from persecution when compared to other raptors. However, death through shooting and poisoning is surely not sustainable given the low population there. Increasing powerline collisions resulting in electrocution from highly dangerous pylons are a major cause of mortality, resulting in unsustainably high population turnover. In one Spanish study area, 56% of juveniles and 13% of adults were killed by electrocution. In France, 44% of radio-tagged post-dispersal juveniles were killed by electrocution. Wind farms in Spain are a potential growing source of changed territories and deaths for Bonelli's eagles but they are likely to be less effected locally than golden eagles. Lead poisoning from bullets in injured small game, which have been associated with high lead levels in eagle feathers in several parts of their range. Research from western Europe and northeastern Africa has indicated low genetic diversity in these populations, which cause concerns of a genetic bottleneck for the species in these former strongholds.</p><p>Research has indicated that the most significant predicted cause to a strong recovery for Bonellis eagles in Europe would be conservation of appropriate habitats, followed by higher survival rates for territorial and non-territorial eagles. It was suggested in 2008 that reducing risk of electric powerline collisions and reducing persecution are the most immediate and significant measures that should be taken to retain Bonelli's eagles in Spain. Research indicated that 99% of avian mortality would be reduced by modifying only 27% of the pylons in areas inhabited by the eagles. As reported by 2015, biologists in coordination with local authorities started to properly insulate dangerous powerlines in green areas in order to help converse this and other threatened birds. It was shown that the local population growth rates increased quickly as a result (from 0.82 to 0.98). However, this study showed an apparent increase of anthropogenic mortality from other causes, such as car collisions, in sync with reduced electrocution. It was estimated that for stage of 2008-2014, 0.28 and 0.64 of mortality was still due to electrocution for territorial and non-territorial eagles. In further efforts to converse the species locally, Spanish researchers have provided supplemental feedings to these eagles, which may improve their odds of successfully producing young.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n\n\n<h2><span id=\"External_links\">External links</span></h2>\n<ul><li>Bonelli's eagle in Spain</li>\n<li>Bonelli's eagle Conservation Biology Team of the University of Barcelona</li>\n<li>Ageing and sexing (PDF; 5.4 MB) by Javier Blasco-Zumeta &amp; Gerd-Michael Heinze</li>\n<li>BirdLife species factsheet for <i>Aquila fasciata</i></li>\n<li><cite class=\"citation web\">\"Aquila fasciata\". <i>Avibase</i>.</cite><span title=\"ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rft.genre=unknown&amp;rft.jtitle=Avibase&amp;rft.atitle=Aquila+fasciata&amp;rft_id=https%3A%2F%2Favibase.bsc-eoc.org%2Fspecies.jsp%3Flang%3DEN%26avibaseid%3D05F1144132A7E4FF&amp;rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fen.wikipedia.org%3ABonelli%27s+eagle\"></span><link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r951705291\"> </li>\n<li><cite class=\"citation web\">\"Bonelli's eagle media\". <i>Internet Bird Collection</i>.</cite><span title=\"ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rft.genre=unknown&amp;rft.jtitle=Internet+Bird+Collection&amp;rft.atitle=Bonelli%26%2339%3Bs+eagle+media&amp;rft_id=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.hbw.com%2Fibc%2Fspecies%2Fbonellis-eagle-hieraaetus-fasciatus&amp;rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fen.wikipedia.org%3ABonelli%27s+eagle\"></span><link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r951705291\"></li>\n<li>Bonelli's eagle photo gallery at VIREO (Drexel University)</li>\n<li>Interactive range map of <i>Aquila fasciata</i> at IUCN Red List maps</li>\n<li>Audio recordings of Bonelli's eagle on Xeno-canto.</li>\n<li>Life Bonelli</li></ul> "

They are found in the Indian subcontinent, Southeast Asia, and Australia. They are found mainly on the coast and in inland wetlands, where they feed on dead fish and other prey. Adults have a reddish-brown body plumage contrasting with their white head and breast which make them easy to distinguish from other birds of prey.\n</p>\n\n\n<h2><span id=\"Taxonomy\">Taxonomy</span></h2>\n\n<p>In 1760, French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson described and illustrated the Brahminy kite in the first volume of his <i>Oiseaux</i> based on a specimen collected in Pondicherry, India. He used the French name <i>L'aigle de Pondichery</i>. The brahminy kite was included by the French polymath Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon in his <i>Histoire Naturelle des Oiseaux</i>. It was also illustrated in a hand-coloured plate engraved by Fran\u00e7ois-Nicolas Martinet in the <i>Planches Enlumin\u00e9es D'Histoire Naturelle</i> which was produced under the supervision of Edme-Louis Daubenton to accompany Buffon's text.  Neither Brisson nor Buffon included a scientific name but in 1783 the Dutch naturalist Pieter Boddaert coined the binomial name <i>Falco indus</i> in his catalogue of the <i>Planches Enlumin\u00e9es</i>. The brahminy kite is now placed with the whistling kite in the genus <i>Haliastur</i> that was erected by the English naturalist Prideaux John Selby in 1840.</p><p>Four subspecies are recognized:</p>\n<ul><li><i>H. i. indus</i> (Boddaert, 1783) \u2013 South Asia</li>\n<li><i>H. i. intermedius</i> Blyth, 1865 \u2013 Malay Peninsula , Greater and Lesser Sunda Islands, Sulawesi and the Philippines</li>\n<li><i>H. i. girrenera</i> (Vieillot, 1822) \u2013 New Guinea, Bismarck Archipelago and north Australia</li>\n<li><i>H. i. flavirostris</i> Condon &amp; Amadon, 1954 \u2013 Solomon Islands</li></ul><h2><span id=\"Description\">Description</span></h2>\n\n<p>The brahminy kite is distinctive and contrastingly coloured, with chestnut plumage except for the white head and breast and black wing tips.

The pale patch on the underwing carpal region is of a squarish shape and separated from <i>Buteo</i> buzzards.\nThe brahminy kite is about the same size as the black kite (<i>Milvus migrans</i>) and has a typical kite flight, with wings angled, but its tail is rounded unlike the <i>Milvus</i> species, red kite, and black kite, which have forked tails.

In southern and eastern Australia, it is August to October, and April to June in the north and west. The nests are constructed of small branches and sticks with a bowl inside and lined with leaves, and are located in various trees, often mangroves. They show considerable site fidelity nesting in the same area year after year. In some rare instances, they have been seen to nest on the ground under trees. A clutch of two dull-white or bluish-white oval eggs measuring 52 x 41\u00a0mm is laid. Both parents take part in nest building and feeding, but likely only the female incubates. The incubation period is about 26 to 27 days.</p><p>It is primarily a scavenger, feeding mainly on dead fish and crabs, especially in wetlands and marshland, but occasionally hunts live prey such as hares and bats. They may also indulge in kleptoparasitism and attempt to steal prey from other birds. Brahminy kites have even been recorded taking advantage of Irrawaddy dolphins herding fish to the surface, in the Mekong River. A rare instance of a bird feeding on honey at the hive of <i>Apis florea</i> has been recorded.</p><p>Young birds may indulge in play behaviour, dropping leaves and attempting to catch them in the air. When fishing over water, they may sometimes land in the water, but manage to swim and take off without much trouble.</p><p>They roost communally on large and isolated trees and as many as 600 have been seen at one location.</p><p>They may mob larger raptors such as the <i>Aquila</i> eagles. In some incidents where brahminy kites mobbed steppe eagles (<i>Aquila rapax</i>), they were attacked and injured or killed.</p><p>A number of ectoparasitic bird lice in the genera <i>Kurodaia</i>, <i>Colpocephalum</i>, and <i>Degeeriella</i> have been reported.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"In_culture\">In culture</span></h2>\n<p>Known as <b>elang bondol</b> in Indonesia, the brahminy kite is the official mascot of Jakarta.

Although mainly seen on the plains, there are a few records from above 3,000m, mainly from Ladakh.</p><p>This passerine is typically found in dry forest, scrub jungle and cultivation and is often found close to human habitations. They especially favour areas with waterlogged or marshy lands.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Behaviour_and_ecology\">Behaviour and ecology</span></h2>\n<p>Like most starlings, the brahminy starling is omnivorous, eating fruit and insects. They have been known to feed on the fruits of <i>Thevetia peruviana</i> which are toxic to many vertebrates. These birds are not as arboreal as the grey-headed mynas and they form small flocks that mix with other mynas on grass covered ground. They sometimes forage beside grazing cattle. They also visit flowers for nectar, particularly <i>Salmalia</i>, <i>Butea monosperma</i> and <i>Erythrina</i>. They roost communally in large numbers in leafy trees, often in the company of parakeets and other mynas.</p><p>It builds its nest in tree holes or artificial cavities. The breeding season is March to September but varies with location, being earlier in southern India. The season coincides with the fruiting of many plants and the young hatch just as the rains begin. The male selects the nest, sometimes having to compete with other hole-nesters such as barbets and sparrows. The male displays by puffing up feathers, fanning the tail, erecting the crest and raising up its bill. Both sexes take part in nest building. The nest is lined with grass, feathers and rags. The normal clutch is three to four eggs which are pale bluish green. The females do not add replacement eggs when eggs are removed nor do they stop laying if an egg is artificially added. Incubation begins only after laying the second egg with the female brooding at night with the male share limited to brief periods during the day. The eggs hatch in about 12 to 14 days. The young fledge and leave the nest when they are three weeks old. The young are fed with insects in the early stages and grains in the later stages. After feeding the parents wait for the young to eject faecal pellets which they carefully remove and drop about 20 metres (66\u00a0ft) away from the nest. Two or three broods may be raised in succession.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Taxonomy_and_systematics\">Taxonomy and systematics</span></h2>\n<p>The starling genera were found to be polyphyletic on the basis of molecular phylogeny and this has led to changes in the genus placements.

In Europe, it forms large flocks in the winter, sometimes with thousands or even millions of birds in a single flock. Such large gatherings occur especially if beech mast is abundant. Bramblings do not require beech mast in the winter, but winter flocks of bramblings will move until they find it. This may be an adaptation to avoid competition with the common chaffinch. Bramblings mostly eat seedsin winter, but insects in summer. It builds its nest in a tree fork, and decorates the exterior with moss or lichen to make it less conspicuous. It lays 4\u20139 eggs.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n\n<h2><span id=\"External_links\">External links</span></h2>\n<ul><li>Internet Bird Collection: Brambling</li>\n<li>Audio recordings from Xeno-canto</li>\n<li>Stamps Belgium, China, Taiwan</li></ul>"

It is found across South and Southeast Asia and is the sole species in the genus <i>Metopidius</i>. Like other jacanas it forages on lilies and other floating aquatic vegetation, the long feet spreading out its weight and preventing sinking. The sexes are alike but females are slightly larger and are polyandrous, maintaining a harem of males during the breeding season in the monsoon rains. Males maintain territories, with one male in the harem chosen to incubate the eggs and take care of the young. When threatened, young chicks may be carried to safety by the male under his wings.\n</p>\n\n\n<h2><span id=\"Taxonomy_and_systematics\">Taxonomy and systematics</span></h2>\n<p>The bronze-winged jacana was formally described by the English ornithologist John Latham in 1790 and given the binomial name <i>Parra indica</i>. He placed it in the genus <i>Parra</i> along with all the other jacanas. Latham had earlier included the species in a supplement to his <i>A General Synopsis of Birds</i> but had not coined a scientific name. The present genus <i>Metopidius</i> was introduced by the German zoologist Johann Georg Wagler in 1832. The bronze-winged jacana is the only species within the genus. The name <i>Metopidius</i> is from the Ancient Greek word <i>met\u014dpidios</i> meaning \"on the forehead\", referring to the frontal lappet. The specific epithet <i>indicus</i> is the Latin word for \"Indian\". There are no recognised subspecies.</p>\n\n<p>Like other jacanas it has 10 tail feathers and the oil gland is tufted. Many jacana species have a carpal spur that is used in territorial fights. In some species the spur is reduced but the wing bones are modified. The carpal spur is reduced to a tubercle in the bronze-winged jacana. In the genera <i>Actophilornis</i>, and <i>Irediparra</i> the radius bone is flattened and blade-like (and associated with a reduced spur) and is thought to be an adaptation either for territorial combat, or for brooding eggs and carrying young under the wings. In <i>Metopidius</i>, the radius curves and diverges to form a broad gap between the radius and ulna. Male jacanas, based on observations in the African jacana, incubate eggs and move their forewings under the eggs so as to hold them between the body and the wing. This behaviour known as wing-brooding may be aided by the flattened radius bone.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Description\">Description</span></h2>\n<p>Bronze-winged jacanas are rail-like, large, short tailed birds that appear dark at a distance except for the supercilium. They are 29\u00a0cm (11\u00a0in) in length. The sexes are similar but the females are slightly larger than the males. The wings are bronzy brown with a green sheen and have a reduced tubercular carpal spur. The head, neck and breast are black and contrast with the broad white supercilium that runs from over the eye to the back of the neck. The lower back and tail coverts are chestnut. The tail is stubby and reddish brown with black terminal band. The greenish yellow bill has a red-base to the upper mandible. A lappet or frontal shield extends up over the forehead and is reddish purple. The legs are greenish. The toes are long and the straight and the elongated nail on the hind toe is longer than the toe. Downy chicks are light brown with a dark stripe running down the nape. Young birds have brown upperparts, a rufous crown, white underparts, a buff foreneck, an undeveloped frontal shield, and may have a dull supercilium. Adults can be confused at a distance with the common moorhen (which is found in similar habitat) and with the watercock and while young can appear similar to the young of the pheasant-tailed jacana, they lack the black necklace seen in that species.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Distribution_and_habitat\">Distribution and habitat</span></h2>\n<p>The species is widely distributed across the Indian Subcontinent (but not Sri Lanka or western Pakistan) and Southeast Asia mainly in low elevations. Both this species and the pheasant-tailed jacana can occur in the same habitat. It is sedentary apart from seasonal dispersal in response to drought and rains. They are able to use wetlands covered in introduced weeds such as water hyacinth and make use of the cover provided by <i>Ipomoea aquatica</i> when breeding.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Behaviour_and_ecology\">Behaviour and ecology</span></h2>\n\n\n<p>Bronze-winged jacanas are found singly or in pairs foraging on aquatic vegetation. They balance on their long legs and long toes, and feed on plant material (claimed to be purely incidental), insects and other invertebrates picked from the floating vegetation or the water's surface. Call is a wheezy piping <i>seek-seek-seek</i> given mostly in alarm. When threatened they sometimes hide by submerging themselves. The breeding season starts after the rains (June to September in India but occasional breeding in March rains reported in Rajasthan). Males defend territories from other males with open wing and neck stretched displays which can escalate to pecking. The territory maintenance activities are at a maximum from around 9 to 11 AM. The nest is a small platform of stems and leaves of <i>Pistia</i>, <i>Nymphoides</i>, <i>Hydrilla</i>, and <i>Eichhornia</i> placed on a mat of vegetation but eggs may also be laid directly on the leaf of a lotus plant. The usual clutch is four, the eggs are very conical, glossy brown with irregular black zig-zag markings. Incubation and care of the young is entirely left to males. The eggs hatch in 29 days. Predation rates of eggs are high, up to 94% were lost in one study to various predators including birds and turtles. Young chicks may be sheltered between the wings and carried to safety. They become independent of their father when they are about ten weeks old.</p><p>\nNematode parasites, <i>Gongylonema indica</i> and <i>Stellocaronema alii</i> and the feather louse <i>Rallicola indicus</i> have been described from specimens of the bronze-winged jacana.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Mating_system\">Mating system</span></h3>\n<p>Bronze-winged jacanas, like other jacanas, show a reversal of sex-roles with the female being larger, territorial, polyandrous, and competing with other females to maintain harems of males to incubate their clutches of eggs. Each female's territory encompasses one to four males and their individual territories. Heavier males defend their territories from other males and the degree of polyandry of females is a trade-off based on the sizes of the male territories and the number of males in the harems. Females mate with multiple males, leading to intense sperm competition, and the male that receives (termed as receivers) a clutch of eggs for incubation may destroy clutches in which their paternity is in doubt. In addition to the territorial males, there may be many \"floater\" males that attempt to copulate with females. Females may copulate more often with receiver males to ensure clutch survival while also copulating with non-receivers to maintain their harem. The fitness cost of clutches destroyed by receivers is much higher than losing males from her harem. Males make a yelling call to gain the attention of females. Males yell more when in larger harems. Females appear to use yells to assess male quality, and copulate with males that yelled more.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n\n<h2><span id=\"External_links\">External links</span></h2>\n<ul><li>Xeno-canto: audio recordings of the bronze-winged jacana</li></ul><p> Media related to <span>Metopidius indicus</span> at Wikimedia Commons\n</p>"

The other grouping is the barn owls, Tytonidae.\n</p><p>The brown hawk-owl is a resident breeder in most of tropical south Asia from the Middle East to south China. Its habitat is well-wooded country and forest. It lays three to five eggs in a tree hole.\n</p><p>The brown hawk-owl is a medium-sized (32\u00a0cm) owl with a hawk-like shape due to its long tail and lack of a distinct facial disk. The upperparts are dark brown, with a barred tail.  The underparts are whitish with reddish-brown streaking, although the subspecies found in the Andaman Islands has dark brown underparts. The eyes are large and yellow. Sexes are similar.</p><p>This species is very nocturnal but it can often be located by the small birds that mob it while it is roosting in a tree. It feeds mainly on large insects, frogs, lizards, small birds, and mice. The call is a repeated low soft, musical <i>oo-uk ...ooo-uk...</i> which may be heard at dusk and dawn.  This owl is quite common in towns and cities like Colombo, Sri Lanka as well as suburban areas close to buildings.\n</p><p>There are two records of the brown hawk-owl in the western hemisphere: an individual photographed on St. Paul Island, Alaska, on August 27, 2007, and a dead owl found on Kiska Island in 2008.</p>\n\n\n<h2><span id=\"Gallery\">Gallery</span></h2>\n<ul class=\"gallery mw-gallery-traditional\"><li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\">\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\">\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\">\n</ul><h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n\n<h2><span id=\"Further_reading\">Further reading</span></h2>\n<ul><li><cite id=\"CITEREFGrimmettCarol_InskippTim_Inskipp1999\" class=\"citation book\">Grimmett, Richard; Carol Inskipp; Tim Inskipp (1999). <i>Birds of India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Sri Lanka, and the Maldives</i>.

The adults will dive for food from December through April, which is when there are more large benthic organisms. Since this period is also the breeding season of the brown dipper, more food is required, so diving for large food is necessary. However, the adults will forage by wading and picking at the stream bottom for the rest of the year. Brown dipper chicks and fledglings will also forage by diving. One small population wintering at a hot spring in Suntar-Khayata Mountains of Siberia feeds underwater when air temperatures drop below -55 C. Following typhoons, brown dippers in upland Taiwanese streams are displaced by flooding into relatively poorer quality streams that likely play an important refuge. </p>\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>"

Of the four living species of fish owl, it is the most widely distributed, most common and best-studied.

Currently, the brown fish owl is classified in the genus <i>Ketupa</i> and four subspecies are recognised as valid taxa:</p>\n<ul><li>Sri Lankan brown fish owl (<i>K. zeylonensis zeylonensis</i>) is the smallest and darkest coloured subspecies with a wing chord of 355 to 405\u00a0mm (14.0 to 15.9\u00a0in), a tarsus of 85 to 90\u00a0mm (3.3 to 3.5\u00a0in), a tail of 177 to 206\u00a0mm (7.0 to 8.1\u00a0in), and a bill of 42 to 48\u00a0mm (1.7 to 1.9\u00a0in). The wing length averages 92% shorter than in northern subspecies. One male was found to have weighed 1,100\u00a0g (2.4\u00a0lb).</li>\n<li>Common brown fish owl (<i>K. z. leschenaultii</i>) occurs from the Indian subcontinent to Myanmar and Thailand. It is of medium hue with lighter markings than the nominate subspecies. It has a wing chord of 370 to 430\u00a0mm (15 to 17\u00a0in), a tail of 186 to 210\u00a0mm (7.3 to 8.3\u00a0in), a tarsus of 71 to 90\u00a0mm (2.8 to 3.5\u00a0in) and a bill of 49 to 52\u00a0mm (1.9 to 2.0\u00a0in). The wing chord of 16 males in India averaged 402\u00a0mm (15.8\u00a0in) and their bills averaged 49\u00a0mm (1.9\u00a0in) while 15 females averaged 395\u00a0mm (15.6\u00a0in) in wing chord and 51.5\u00a0mm (2.03\u00a0in) in bill length. A male was found to weigh 1,105\u00a0g (2.436\u00a0lb) and a female was found to weigh 1,308\u00a0g (2.884\u00a0lb).</li>\n<li>Western brown fish owl (<i>K. z. semenowi</i>) occurs from southern Turkey through Iran and Pakistan to northeastern India. It is paler and slightly larger than the common brown fish owl with a somewhat tawny hue. Its wing chord is 396 to 434\u00a0mm (15.6 to 17.1\u00a0in) with a tarsus of 74 to 90\u00a0mm (2.9 to 3.5\u00a0in), a tail of 197 to 214\u00a0mm (7.8 to 8.4\u00a0in) and a bill of 49 to 54\u00a0mm (1.9 to 2.1\u00a0in).</li>\n<li>Eastern brown fish owl (<i>K. z. orientalis</i>) occurs in north-eastern Myanmar, Vietnam and southeastern China and Hainan Island. It is somewhat darker than the common brown fish owl with a larger tarsus. Its wing chord is 365 to 457\u00a0mm (14.4 to 18.0\u00a0in), with a tail of 195 to 210\u00a0mm (7.7 to 8.3\u00a0in) and a tarsus of 67 to 70\u00a0mm (2.6 to 2.8\u00a0in).</li></ul><h3><span id=\"Fossil_records\">Fossil records</span></h3>\n<p>In prehistoric times, this species may have been present across the central and eastern Mediterranean basin, in particular on islands. The Late Pleistocene <i>Bubo insularis</i> is typically considered to include the fragmentary remains originally described as <i>Ophthalmomegas lamarmorae</i> due to a mix-up with the fossil macaque <i>Macaca majori</i> and subsequently unstudied for many decades. Its fossil bones suggest a bird the size of a large spotted eagle-owl (<i>B. africanus</i>), a bit smaller still than the smallest living fish owls. It was certainly smallish but long-legged by eagle-owl standards, and its wing proportions differed conspicuously from a typical horned eagle owl. On the other hand, its leg and foot bones were more similar to those of a typical eagle-owl. Some consider it a specialized paleosubspecies of the brown fish owl.\nIts oldest remains date back at least to the Early Pliocene, about 5 million years ago. It was probably widely distributed around 120,000 years ago. After the onset of the last glacial period, less than 100,000 years ago, it disappeared from the western part of its range. The Late Miocene-Early Pliocene <i>\"Strix\" perpasta</i> is unlikely to belong in that genus, and also sometimes merged with <i>B. insularis</i>.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Description\">Description</span></h2>\n<p>The brown fish owl has prominent ear tufts and rufous brown upperparts that are heavily streaked with black or dark brown. Its underparts are buffy-fulvous to whitish, with wavy dark brown streaks and finer brown barring. Its throat is white and conspicuously puffed. Its facial disk is indistinct, the bill dark and the iris golden yellow. Its featherless feet are yellow. Two-year old brown fish owls are somewhat paler than adults. Female and male differ slightly in size.</p><p>In body size, it ranges from 48 to 61\u00a0cm (19 to 24\u00a0in) with a wingspan from 125 to 140\u00a0cm (49 to 55\u00a0in). Its weight varies considerably, ranging from 1.1 to 2.5\u00a0kg (2.4 to 5.5\u00a0lb). Some of the variability is attributed to the range of sizes across the subspecies. Also, females are invariably at least somewhat larger than males and condition of birds is variable. It is slightly larger than the buffy fish owl with a darker brown hue.</p><p>Compared to eagle owls of similar length, fish owls tend to be even shorter in tail length and even heavier in build, have relatively larger wings, have considerably longer legs, and have a rough texture to the bottom of their toes. At least the latter two features are clear adaptations to aid these owls in capturing fish. Diurnal raptors who feed largely on fish have similar, if not identical, rough texture under their toes, which helps these birds grasp slippery fish. Unlike diurnal raptors who capture fish such as the osprey (<i>Pandion haliaetus</i>) as compared to most terrestrial raptors, the fish owls have large, powerful, and curved talons and a longitudinal sharp keel sitting under the middle claw with all having sharp cutting edges that are very much like those of eagle owls. Also, unlike fish-eating diurnal raptors will not submerge any part of their body while hunting, preferring only to put their feet into the water, although fish owls will hunt on foot, wading into the shallows. Unlike most owls, the feathers of fish owls are not soft to the touch and they lack the comb and hair-like fringes to the primaries, which allow other owls to fly silently in order to ambush their prey. Due to the lack of these feather-specializations, fish owl wing beats make sounds. The brown fish owl in particular is said to have a noisy wing beat, sometimes described as producing a singing sound, but another description claimed they could be \"as silent as any other owl\" in flight. The lack of a deep facial disc in fish owls is another indication of the unimportance of sound relative to vision in these owls, as facial disc depth (as well as inner ear size) are directly related to how important sound is to an owl's hunting behavior. Also different from most any other kind of owl, the bill is placed on the face between the eyes rather below it, which is said to impart this fish owl with a \"remarkably morose and sinister expression\". Similar adaptations, such as unwillingness to submerge beyond their legs and lack of sound-muffling feathers are also seen in the African fishing owls, which do not seem to be directly related. The brown fish owl has sometimes been regarded as conspecific with the Blakiston's fish owl (<i>B. blakistoni</i>), but there is an approximately 2,000\u00a0km (1,200\u00a0mi) gap in their distributions, not to mention a large number of physical differences not the least of which is the Blakiston's considerably greater size.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Distribution_and_habitat\">Distribution and habitat</span></h2>\n\n<p>The brown fish owl is an all-year resident throughout most tropical and subtropical parts of the Indian Subcontinent to Southeast Asia and adjoining regions. West of its main range, it is patchily distributed to the Levant (possibly extinct) and southern Asia Minor (recently rediscovered). The typical habitat of brown fish owls is forest and woodland bordering streams, lakes or rice fields. It inhabits mainly the lowlands, from open woodland to dense forest as well as in plantations; in the Himalayas foothills it ranges into submontane forest up to 1,500\u00a0m (4,900\u00a0ft) above mean sea level or so but not higher. It frequently spends the day in stands of bamboo or other large shady trees. They be found around water reservoirs, along canals, on the outskirts of villages and along sea coasts. Western birds are found in semiarid landscape and may breed in oases in arid regions. Regardless of habitat, it rarely strays far from larger bodies of water such as rivers and lakes.\nBeing a large predatory bird, the brown fish owl is only rarely found at a high population density, an exception being Sri Lanka, where this particular owl's adaptability to human habitat change has been beneficial in continued high numbers.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Behaviour_and_ecology\">Behaviour and ecology</span></h2>\n\n<p>The calls of the buffy fish owl are described as a deep humming <i>boom-uh-boom</i>, a <i>hup hup hu</i> and a loud <i>huhuhuhuhuhuhu</i>. A trisyllabic <i>tu-hoo-hoo</i> is seemingly the territorial song emitted before breeding. Its call has been described as comparable to that of a distant Eurasian bittern (<i>Botaurus stellaris</i>).</p><p>The buffy fish owl is nocturnal but can often be located by the small birds that mob it while roosting in a tree. However, in some areas it may be semi-diurnal and has been seen hunting during daytime, especially in cloudy weather. Brown fish owl primarily hunt by stationing itself on a rock overhang or hanging perch over water, or by wading into shallow waters. It grabs food by gliding over the water, nearly skimming it with its feet and grabbing its prey by quickly extending its long legs. It feeds mainly on fishes, frogs and aquatic crustaceans, especially <i>Potamon</i> crabs. It usually selects the larger freshwater fish available in waterways. Compared to the tawny fish owl, which prefers flowing waters, brown fish owls frequently hunt in still or stagnant waters. By number in the Melghat Tiger Reserve in India, freshwater crabs of the family Gecarcinucidae (of genus <i>Barytelphusa</i>) almost totally dominated the diet. Brown fish owls may be attracted to ornmental fish ponds or commercial fisheries in order to exploit the easily caught fish at such locations. Amniotes, in particular terrestrial ones, are seldom taken. However, other recorded foods have included snakes, lizards, water beetles, other insects, small mammals (including bats) and occasionally water birds. In Melghat, the largest biomass of food consisted of small mammals, namely rats (<i>Rattus</i> ssp.), other types of murids and Asian house shrews (<i>Suncus murinus</i>). Birds hunted by brown fish owls have including lesser whistling duck (<i>Dendrocygna javanica</i>) and Indian pond heron (<i>Ardeola grayii</i>). One unusual prey item recorded was a 28\u00a0cm (11\u00a0in) long monitor lizard. Competition may occur between this species and Pallas's fish eagles (<i>Haliaeetus leucoryphus</i>) as well as dusky eagle owls (<i>B. coromandus</i>), but the brown fish owl is more terrestrial than the fish eagle and consumes more invertebrates than either of those species, the eagle feeding mainly on fish followed by water birds and the eagle owl feeding mainly on mammals followed by land birds. If hungry, brown fish owls will scavenge carrion, a rare behavior for owls. A case where a putrefying crocodile (<i>Crocodylus</i> ssp.) carcass was consumed by this species was observed.</p><p>As mentioned above, the prehistoric <i>B. insularis</i> is sometimes included in the brown fish owl. If this is correct, the different foot anatomy, more similar to that of a typical eagle-owl, would imply that the population had shifted back to terrestrial prey. A likely prey item in this case would have been the Sardinian pika (<i>Prolagus sardus</i>). It has been conjectured that the owls disappeared with their prey due to climate change, but the giant pikas of Sardinia and Corsica still existed around 1750, finally succumbing to habitat destruction, introduced predatory mammals and overhunting soon thereafter.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Reproduction\">Reproduction</span></h3>\n<p>Brown fish owls breed from November to April, with activity tending to peak a bit earlier in the north of their breeding range and a bit later in the more tropical south of their breeding range. The breeding season is concurrent with the dry season, which has the benefit of low water levels and thus crabs and fish being more readily assessible. However, most other owls and diurnal raptors also primarily breed in the dry season as well. As owls do not build nest, brown fish owls are somewhat opportunistic when it comes to nesting sites. Brown fish owls frequently nest in shady spots such as old-growth mango trees (<i>Mangifera</i> ssp.), fig trees, including <i>Ficus religiosa</i> and <i>Ficus benghalensis</i>, <i>Shorea robusta</i> and other large trees in lowland forests. Outside of the bare surface of large branches, nests are often in spots such as overgrown eroded ravines and steep riverbanks with natural holes. However, it may also nest near suitable villages, along wet roadsides, <i>jheels</i>, canals and rice fields. Usually nest are large natural holes, in hollows or at the base of large branches. Deserted nest built by fish eagles and vultures are also sometimes used as nesting locations. Other nesting sites have included rock ledges, caves in shady cliff faces and stone ruins. The clutch is two or occasionally just one egg. 10 eggs in India averaged 58.4\u00a0mm \u00d7\u00a048.9\u00a0mm (2.30\u00a0in \u00d7\u00a01.93\u00a0in) in sizes, with eggs of fish owls to the north averaging slightly larger. Incubation is 38 days or somewhat less, and the young fledge after about seven weeks. The downy chicks are mostly an off-white color and develop into a paler version of adults by their second year.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Threats\">Threats</span></h2>\n<p>Apparently in India, during the festival of Diwali, thousands of owls are killed - though programs to counter this practice are underway -   including this species due to superstitious beliefs about the evil nature of owls and as an attempt to gain the power of black magic. Habitat destruction will eventually cause the species to desert a region. Due to this, it seems to be extinct as a breeding bird in Israel nowadays, attributable largely to damming practices leading to drying up of many waterways. In Israel, it was decimated by the use of the rodenticide Thallium(I) sulfate, which in addition to potential direct exposure through rodents also poisons surface waters.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n\n<h3><span id=\"Further_reading\">Further reading</span></h3>\n<ul><li>Ml\u00edkovsk\u00fd, Ji\u0159\u00ed (2002): <i>Cenozoic Birds of the World, Part 1: Europe</i>.

In flight it resembles a female blue rock thrush and is usually found singly or in pairs on old buildings or rocky areas. The sexes are indistinguishable in the field. When feeding on the ground it sometimes flicks open its wings and tail. It also has a habit of slowly raising its tail slightly, fanning it and bobbing its head. They feed mainly on insects, picked off the ground. They have been known to feed late and forage on insects attracted to artificial lighting.</p><p>They have a wide repertoire of calls. Nearly eight different kinds of calls have been noted and these include territorial calls, begging call, feeding call, alarm call, threat call, contact call, distress call, roosting and emergence calls. The usual call is a short whistling <i>chee</i> delivered with a rapid bob and stretch and the alarm call is a harsh <i>chek-check</i>.

        "details": " <p class=\"mw-empty-elt\">\n</p>\n<p>The <b>brown shrike</b> (<i>Lanius cristatus</i>) is a bird in the shrike family that is found mainly in Asia. It is closely related to the red-backed shrike (<i>L. collurio</i>) and isabelline shrike (<i>L. isabellinus</i>). The genus name, <i>Lanius</i>, is derived from the Latin word for \"butcher\", and some shrikes are also known as \"butcher birds\" because of their feeding habits. The specific <i>cristatus</i> is Latin for \"crested\", used in a broader sense than in English. The common English name \"shrike\" is from Old English <i>scr\u00edc</i>, \"shriek\", referring to the shrill call.</p><p>Like most other shrikes, it has a distinctive black \"bandit-mask\" through the eye and is found mainly in open scrub habitats, where it perches on the tops of thorny bushes in search of prey. Several populations of this widespread species form distinctive subspecies which breed in temperate Asia and migrate to their winter quarters in tropical Asia. They are sometimes found as vagrants in Europe and North America.\n</p>\n\n\n<h2><span id=\"Description\">Description</span></h2>\n\n<p>This shrike is mainly brown on the upper parts and the tail is rounded. The black mask can be paler in winter and has a white brow over it. The underside is creamy with rufous flanks and belly. The wings are brown and lack any white \"mirror\" patches. Females tend to have fine scalloping on the underside and the mask is dark brown and not as well marked as in the male. The distinction is not easy to use in the field but has been tested with breeding birds in Japan where the female can be identified from the presence of a brood patch. The use of multiple measurements allows discrimination of the sex of about 90% of the birds. Subspecies <i>lucionensis</i> has a grey crown shading into the brown upperparts and the rump appears more rufous than the rest of the upper back. The tail is more brownish and not as reddish as in the red-backed shrike. Younger birds of <i>lucionensis</i> have a brown crown and lack the grey on the head. Supspecies <i>superciliosus</i> has a broad white supercilium and a richer reddish crown. The tail is redder and tipped in white.</p><p>A number of confusing forms are known from central Asia where the populations of <i>cristatus</i>, <i>isabellinus</i> and <i>collurio</i> overlap. The taxonomy has been in a state of flux and some forms such as <i>phoenicuroides</i> formerly considered as subspecies of <i>L. cristatus</i> have been moved to the species <i>L. isabellinus</i>. Subspecies <i>lucionensis</i> has been recorded interbreeding with <i>superciliosus</i> in Ishikawa, Japan while <i>superciliosus</i> has interbred with <i>Lanius tigrinus</i> in central Japan.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Distribution\">Distribution</span></h2>\n\n\n<p>The nominate form breeds in northern Asia from Mongolia to Siberia and winters in South Asia, Myanmar and the Malay Peninsula. The race <i>confusus</i> described from the same region is not well marked but is said to have a wider white brow and paler upperparts and is sometimes included within the nominate population. Subspecies <i>superciliosus</i> (sometimes called the Japanese shrike) breeds on the islands of Sakhalin, Kuril and Japan and winters in Hainan, Sumatra, Java, and the Sundas. Subspecies <i>lucionensis</i>, sometimes known as the Philippine shrike (local names: <i>tarat</i> or <i>pakis-kis</i>), breeds in Korea and eastern China wintering mainly in Taiwan and the Philippines but also on the Andaman Islands and in peninsular India. Stuart Baker suggested that the species may breed in the Cachar Hills of Assam but the idea was questioned by Claud Buchanan Ticehurst.</p><p>This species is rare in Europe and vagrants have been recorded in the United States and Canada.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Behaviour_and_ecology\">Behaviour and ecology</span></h2>\n\n<p>The brown shrike is a migratory species and ringing studies show that they have high fidelity to their wintering sites, often returning to the same locations each winter. They begin establishing wintering territories shortly after arrival and their loud chattering or rattling calls are distinctive. Birds that arrive early and establish territories appear to have an advantage over those that arrive later in the winter areas. The timing of their migration is very regular with their arrival in winter to India in August and September and departure in April. During their winter period, they go through a premigratory moult. Their song in the winter quarters is faint and somewhat resembles the call of the rosy starling and often includes mimicry of other birds. The beak remains closed when singing and only throat pulsations are visible although the bird moves its tail up and down while singing.</p><p>The breeding season is late May or June and the breeding habitat includes the taiga, forest to semi-desert where they build a nest in a tree or bush, laying two to six eggs.</p><p>They feed mainly on insects, especially Lepidoptera. Like other shrikes, they impale prey on thorns. Small birds and lizards are also sometimes preyed upon. A white-eye (<i>Zosterops</i>) has been recorded in its larder. They typically look out for prey from a perch and fly down towards the ground to capture them.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n\n<h2><span id=\"Other_sources\">Other sources</span></h2>\n<ul><li><cite id=\"CITEREFLivesey,_TR1935\" class=\"citation journal\">Livesey, TR (1935). \"The status of the Brown Shrike <i>Lanius c. cristatus</i> (Linn.) in the S.

It was first described by Marmaduke Tunstall in his 1771 <i>Ornithologia Britannica</i>. It was formerly classified as a form of the water pipit.\n</p>\n\n\n<h2><span id=\"Description\">Description</span></h2>\n<p>Like most other pipits, the buff-bellied pipit is an undistinguished-looking species which usually can be seen to run around on the ground. The <i>rubescens</i> subspecies (or American pipit) has lightly streaked grey-brown upperparts and is diffusely streaked below on the buff breast and flanks. The belly is whitish, the bill and legs are dark. The <i>japonicus</i> subspecies (or Japanese pipit) is darker above and has bolder black streaking on its whiter underparts; its legs have a reddish hue. The call is a squeaky <i>sip</i>.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Taxonomy\">Taxonomy</span></h2>\n<p>The scientific name is from Latin. <i>Anthus</i> is the name for a small bird of grasslands, and the specific <i>rubescens</i> means \"reddish\", from\n<i>ruber</i>,  \"ruddy\".</p><p>It has two distinctive subspecies, but morphological and DNA sequence differences between them are rather pronounced and they might be considered distinct species pending further research:</p>\n<ul><li><i>A. r. rubescens</i> - <small>(Tunstall, 1771)</small>, <b><span id=\"American_pipit\">American pipit</span></b> \u2013 breeds in northern North America, extending further south in mountainous areas</li>\n<li><i>A. r. japonicus</i> - <small>Temminck &amp; Schlegel, 1847</small>, <b><span id=\"Japanese_pipit\">Japanese pipit</span></b> or <b>Siberian pipit</b> \u2013 breeds in most of the eastern Palearctic (including Japan)</li></ul><p>This species is closely related to Eurasian rock pipit (<i>A. petrosus</i>) and water pipit (<i>A. spinoletta</i>), all three forms having previously been considered conspecific. They can be differentiated by their vocalizations and some visual cues, but rock and buff-bellied pipit are not found sympatrically except as vagrant individuals, and the ranges of buff-bellied and water pipits overlap only in a small area in Central Asia.</p>\n\n<h2><span id=\"Behavior\">Behavior</span></h2>\n<p>Both subspecies of the buff-bellied pipit are migratory. The buff-bellied pipit winters on the Pacific coast of North America, and on the Atlantic coast from the southern North America to Central America. At least regarding the buff-bellied pipit, its wintering range seems to have expanded northwards in the 20th century and the birds seem to spend less time in winter quarters: in northern Ohio, for example, the species was recorded as \"not common\" during migration in May and September/October in the 1900s (decade), but today it is considered a \"widespread migrant\" in that region, found between March and May and from late September to November, with many birds actually wintering this far north. Asian birds winter mainly from Pakistan east to and Southeast Asia, with occasional birds found as far north as Yunnan and some in Japan apparently being all-year residents or migrating but a little. The American and Asian subspecies are rare vagrants to Western and Eastern Europe, respectively.</p><p>Like its relatives, this species is insectivorous. The breeding habitat of buff-bellied pipit is tundra, but outside the breeding season it is found in open lightly vegetated areas, similar to those favoured by the water pipit (<i>A. spinoletta</i>).</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Reproduction:_from_pairing_to_fledging\">Reproduction: from pairing to fledging</span></h2>\n\n<p>The first thing buff-bellied pipits do when they arrive on the breeding site, during snowmelt, is pairing. Indeed, males will start to fight one on one to win over the female and pair with it during the entire breeding season. They also fight for the snow-free sites that would be better for nesting. The moment is also very important because the melting snow implies an increase in arthropods abundance, which constitute the main food source for these birds. After the fight and the pairing, nesting is the next step. Nests are most often found on the ground in dry or wet meadows, always with a helpful protection, but they are never placed in shrubs or trees. The composition of the ideal nest depends on whatever is around the nesting area, but it is usually made of sedge, remains or new fine grass, and sometimes some horse hairs. The final issue buff-bellied pipits have to deal with is nest success. The nest is indeed the target for numerous predators such as ants or hawks. If this step is successful, an egg can be produced. The female will not lay an egg if the conditions, such as temperature and nesting site, are not optimal. If the first attempt fails, her time to lay an egg is reduced. In general, buff-bellied pipits continuously lay eggs over a period of 4 to 5 days after snow-melt (in April\u2013May) until mid-July. After this period, the male testes decrease in size and the female refuses any copulation. The clutch size is usually 5 eggs but it can vary according to snowfalls, the parents\u2019 reproductive ability and predation. Eggs are incubated for 13\u201314 days. During this time, the female does not leave the nest, but is still very reactive to any movement around her. She communicates by singing to the male that brings her food and defends their territory. Four or five days after hatching, the young is skinny, blue-gray in color, and only has its secondary feathers. For a week, the female will brood the clutch, but both parents will feed them. After these 7 days, the birds are ready for fledging but they will still be fed by their parents for 14 days after their departure. Finally, immature birds will form little flocks with other immature birds and wander off.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Status\">Status</span></h2>\n<p>It is a widespread and common species and not considered threatened by the IUCN.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n\n<h2><span id=\"External_links\">External links</span></h2>\n<ul><li>American pipit \u2013 <i>Anthus rubescens</i> \u2013 USGS Patuxent Bird Identification InfoCenter</li>\n<li>American pipit Species Account \u2013 Cornell Lab of Ornithology</li>\n<li><cite class=\"citation web\">\"Buff-bellied pipit videos media\". <i>Internet Bird Collection</i>.</cite><span title=\"ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rft.genre=unknown&amp;rft.jtitle=Internet+Bird+Collection&amp;rft.atitle=Buff-bellied+pipit+videos+media&amp;rft_id=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.hbw.com%2Fibc%2Fspecies%2Fbuff-bellied-pipit-anthus-rubescens&amp;rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fen.wikipedia.org%3ABuff-bellied+pipit\"></span><link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r951705291\"></li>\n<li>American pipit photo gallery at VIREO (Drexel University)</li>\n<li>Interactive range map of <i>Anthus rubescens</i> at IUCN Red List maps</li></ul><p><br></p>"

Despite its extensive range, it is monotypic of its genus, and has no accepted subspecies. The genus name is from Ancient Greek <i>hudros</i>, \"water\", and Latin <i>progne</i>, \"swallow\". The specific <i>caspia</i> is from Latin and, like the English name, refers to the Caspian Sea.</p>\n\n\n<h2><span id=\"Description\">Description</span></h2>\n<p>It is the world's largest tern with a length of 48\u201360\u00a0cm (19\u201324\u00a0in), a wingspan of 127\u2013145\u00a0cm (50\u201357\u00a0in) and a weight of 530\u2013782\u00a0g (18.7\u201327.6\u00a0oz). Adult birds have black legs, and a long thick red-orange bill with a small black tip. They have a white head with a black cap and white neck, belly and tail. The upper wings and back are pale grey; the underwings are pale with dark primary feathers. In flight, the tail is less forked than other terns and wing tips black on the underside. In winter, the black cap is still present (unlike many other terns), but with some white streaking on the forehead. The call is a loud heron-like croak.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Distribution_and_habitat\">Distribution and habitat</span></h2>\n<p>Their breeding habitat is large lakes and ocean coasts in North America (including the Great Lakes), and locally in Europe (mainly around the Baltic Sea and Black Sea), Asia, Africa, and Australasia (Australia and New Zealand). North American birds migrate to southern coasts, the West Indies and northernmost South America. European and Asian birds spend the non-breeding season in the Old World tropics. African and Australasian birds are resident or disperse over short distances.</p><p>In 2016, a nest of the Caspian tern was found in the Cape Krusenstern National Monument in northwestern Alaska, 1,000 miles further north than any previous sighting.  This development was part of a general trend in Alaska of species moving to the north, a tendency ascribed to global warming.</p><p>The global population is about 50,000 pairs; numbers in most regions are stable, but the Baltic Sea population (1400\u20131475 pairs in the early 1990s) is declining and of conservation concern.</p><p>The Caspian tern is one of the species to which the <i>Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds</i> (AEWA) applies.\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Behaviour\">Behaviour</span></h2>\n<h3><span id=\"Feeding\">Feeding</span></h3>\n<p>They feed mainly on fish, which they dive for, hovering high over the water and then plunging. They also occasionally eat large insects, the young and eggs of other birds and rodents. They may fly up to 60\u00a0km (37\u00a0mi) from the breeding colony to catch fish; they often fish on freshwater lakes as well as at sea.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Breeding\">Breeding</span></h3>\n\n<p>Breeding is in spring and summer, with one to three pale blue green eggs, with heavy brown spotting, being laid. They nest either together in colonies, or singly in mixed colonies of other tern and gull species. The nest is on the ground among gravel and sand, or sometimes on vegetation; incubation lasts for 26\u201328 days. The chicks are variable in plumage pattern, from pale creamy to darker grey-brown; this variation assists adults in recognizing their own chicks when returning to the colony from feeding trips. Fledging occurs after 35\u201345 days.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Gallery\">Gallery</span></h2>\n<ul class=\"gallery mw-gallery-traditional\"><li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\">\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\">\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\">\n</ul><h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n\n<h2><span id=\"External_links\">External links</span></h2>\n<ul><li>Caspian Tern species text in The Atlas of Southern African Birds</li>\n<li>BirdLife species factsheet for <i>Hydroprogne caspia</i></li>\n<li><cite class=\"citation web\">\"Hydroprogne caspia\". <i>Avibase</i>.</cite><span title=\"ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rft.genre=unknown&amp;rft.jtitle=Avibase&amp;rft.atitle=Hydroprogne+caspia&amp;rft_id=https%3A%2F%2Favibase.bsc-eoc.org%2Fspecies.jsp%3Flang%3DEN%26avibaseid%3DBC06BC0D1056BC7B&amp;rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fen.wikipedia.org%3ACaspian+tern\"></span><link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r951705291\"> </li>\n<li><cite class=\"citation web\">\"Caspian tern media\". <i>Internet Bird Collection</i>.</cite><span title=\"ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rft.genre=unknown&amp;rft.jtitle=Internet+Bird+Collection&amp;rft.atitle=Caspian+tern+media&amp;rft_id=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.hbw.com%2Fibc%2Fspecies%2Fcaspian-tern-hydroprogne-caspia&amp;rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fen.wikipedia.org%3ACaspian+tern\"></span><link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r951705291\"></li>\n<li>Caspian tern photo gallery at VIREO (Drexel University)</li>\n<li>Interactive range map of <i>Hydroprogne caspia</i> at IUCN Red List maps</li>\n<li>Audio recordings of Caspian tern on Xeno-canto.</li>\n<li><i>Hydroprogne caspia</i> in the Flickr: Field Guide Birds of the World</li>\n<li>Caspian tern media from ARKive </li></ul>"

It is the only member of the monotypic genus <i><b>Bubulcus</b></i>, although some authorities regard two of its subspecies as full species, the western cattle egret and the eastern cattle egret. Despite the similarities in plumage to the egrets of the genus <i>Egretta</i>, it is more closely related to the herons of <i>Ardea</i>. Originally native to parts of Asia, Africa, and Europe, it has undergone a rapid expansion in its distribution and successfully colonised much of the rest of the world in the last century.\n</p><p>It is a white bird adorned with buff plumes in the breeding season. It nests in colonies, usually near bodies of water and often with other wading birds. The nest is a platform of sticks in trees or shrubs. Cattle egrets exploit drier and open habitats more than other heron species. Their feeding habitats include seasonally inundated grasslands, pastures, farmlands, wetlands, and rice paddies. They often accompany cattle or other large mammals, catching insect and small vertebrate prey disturbed by these animals. Some populations  are migratory and others show postbreeding dispersal.\n</p><p>The adult cattle egret has few predators, but birds or mammals may raid its nests, and chicks may be lost to starvation, calcium deficiency, or disturbance from other large birds. This species maintains a special relationship with cattle, which extends to other large grazing mammals; wider human farming is believed to be a major cause of their suddenly expanded range. The cattle egret removes ticks and flies from cattle and consumes them. This benefits both species, but it has been implicated in the spread of tick-borne animal diseases.\n</p>\n\n\n<h2><span id=\"Taxonomy\">Taxonomy</span></h2>\n\n<p>The cattle egret was first described in 1758 by Carl Linnaeus in his <i>Systema naturae</i> as <i>Ardea ibis</i>, but was moved to its current genus by Charles Lucien Bonaparte in 1855. Its genus name <i>Bubulcus</i> is Latin for herdsman, referring, like the English name, to this species' association with cattle. <i>Ibis</i> is a Latin and Greek word which originally referred to another white wading bird, the sacred ibis, but was applied to this species in error.</p><p>The cattle egret has two geographical races, which are sometimes classified as full species, the western cattle egret, <i>B. ibis</i>, and eastern cattle egret, <i>B. coromandus</i>. The two forms were split by McAllan and Bruce, but were regarded as conspecific by almost all other recent authors until the publication of the influential <i>Birds of South Asia</i>. The eastern subspecies <i>B. i. coromandus</i>, described by Pieter Boddaert in 1783, breeds in South Asia, Eastern Asia  and Australasia, and the western nominate form occupies the rest of the species range, including Western Asia, Europe, Africa and the Americas. Some authorities recognise a third Seychelles subspecies, <i>B. i. seychellarum</i>, which was first described by Finn Salomonsen in 1934.</p><p>Despite superficial similarities in appearance, the cattle egret is more closely related to the genus <i>Ardea</i>, which comprises the great or typical herons and the great egret (<i>A. alba</i>), than to the majority of species termed egrets in the genus <i>Egretta</i>. Rare cases of hybridization with little blue herons <i>Egretta caerulea</i>, little egrets <i>Egretta garzetta</i> and snowy egrets <i>Egretta thula</i> have been recorded.</p><p>An older english name for the cattle egret is buff-backed heron.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Description\">Description</span></h2>\n\n<p>The cattle egret is a stocky heron with an 88\u201396\u00a0cm (35\u201338\u00a0in) wingspan; it is 46\u201356\u00a0cm (18\u201322\u00a0in) long and weighs 270\u2013512\u00a0g (9.5\u201318.1\u00a0oz). It has a relatively short, thick neck, a sturdy bill, and a hunched posture. The nonbreeding adult has mainly white plumage, a yellow bill, and greyish-yellow legs. During the breeding season, adults of the nominate western subspecies develop orange-buff plumes on the back, breast, and crown, and the bill, legs, and irises become bright red for a brief period prior to pairing. The sexes are similar, but the male is marginally larger and has slightly longer breeding plumes than the female; juvenile birds lack coloured plumes and have a black bill.</p><p><i>B. i. coromandus</i> differs from the nominate subspecies in breeding plumage, when the buff colour on its head extends to the cheeks and throat, and the plumes are more golden in colour. This subspecies' bill and tarsus are longer on average than in <i>B. i. ibis</i>. <i>B. i. seychellarum</i> is smaller and shorter-winged than the other forms. It has white cheeks and throat, like <i>B. i. ibis</i>, but the nuptial plumes are golden, as with <i>B. i. coromandus</i>. Individuals with abnormally grey, melanistic plumages have been recorded.</p><p>The positioning of the egret's eyes allows for binocular vision during feeding, and physiological studies suggest that the species may be capable of crepuscular or nocturnal activity. Adapted to foraging on land, they have lost the ability possessed by their wetland relatives to accurately correct for light refraction by water.</p><p>This species gives a quiet, throaty <i>rick-rack</i> call at the breeding colony, but is otherwise largely silent.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Distribution_and_habitat\">Distribution and habitat</span></h2>\n\n<p>The cattle egret has undergone one of the most rapid and wide-reaching natural expansions of any bird species. It was originally native to parts of southern Spain and Portugal, tropical and subtropical Africa, and humid tropical and subtropical Asia. At the end of the 19th century, it began expanding its range into southern Africa, first breeding in the Cape Province in 1908. Cattle egrets were first sighted in the Americas on the boundary of Guiana and Suriname in 1877, having apparently flown across the Atlantic Ocean. In the 1930s, the species is thought to have become established in that area. It is now widely distributed across Brazil.\n</p><p>The species first arrived in North America in 1941 (these early sightings were originally dismissed as escapees), bred in Florida in 1953, and spread rapidly, breeding for the first time in Canada in 1962. It is now commonly seen as far west as California. It was first recorded breeding in Cuba in 1957, in Costa Rica in 1958, and in Mexico in 1963, although it was probably established before then. In Europe, the species had historically declined in Spain and Portugal, but in the latter part of the 20th century, it expanded back through the Iberian Peninsula, and then began to colonise other parts of Europe, southern France in 1958, northern France in 1981, and Italy in 1985. Breeding in the United Kingdom was recorded for the first time in 2008, only a year after an influx seen in the previous year. In 2008, cattle egrets were also reported as having moved into Ireland for the first time. This trend has continued and cattle egrets have become more numerous in southern Britain with influxes in some numbers during the nonbreeding seasons of 2007/08 and 2016/17. They bred in Britain again in 2017, following an influx in the previous winter, and may become established there.</p><p>In Australia, the colonisation began in the 1940s, with the species establishing itself in the north and east of the continent. It began to regularly visit New Zealand in the 1960s. Since 1948, the cattle egret has been permanently resident in Israel. Prior to 1948, it was only a winter visitor.</p><p>The massive and rapid expansion of the cattle egret's range is due to its relationship with humans and their domesticated animals. Originally adapted to a commensal relationship with large grazing and browsing animals, it was easily able to switch to domesticated cattle and horses. As the keeping of livestock spread throughout the world, the cattle egret was able to occupy otherwise empty niches. Many populations of cattle egrets are highly migratory and dispersive, and this has helped the species' range expansion. The species has been seen as a vagrant in various sub-Antarctic islands, including South Georgia, Marion Island, the South Sandwich Islands, and the South Orkney Islands. A small flock of eight birds was also seen in Fiji in 2008.</p><p>In addition to the natural expansion of its range, cattle egrets have been deliberately introduced into a few areas. The species was introduced to Hawaii in 1959, and to the Chagos Archipelago in 1955. Successful releases were also made in the Seychelles and Rodrigues, but attempts to introduce the species to Mauritius failed. Numerous birds were also released by Whipsnade Zoo in England, but the species was never established.</p><p>Although the cattle egret sometimes feeds in shallow water, unlike most herons it is typically found in fields and dry grassy habitats, reflecting its greater dietary reliance on terrestrial insects rather than aquatic prey.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Migration_and_movements\">Migration and movements</span></h2>\n<p>Some populations of cattle egrets are migratory, others are dispersive, and distinguishing between the two can be difficult. In many areas, populations can be both sedentary and migratory. In the Northern Hemisphere, migration is from cooler climes to warmer areas, but cattle egrets nesting in Australia migrate to cooler Tasmania and New Zealand in the winter and return in the spring. Migration in western Africa is in response to rainfall, and in South America, migrating birds travel south of their breeding range in the nonbreeding season. Populations in southern India appear to show local migrations in response to the monsoons. They move north from Kerala after September. During winter, many birds have been seen flying at night with flocks of Indian pond herons (<i>Ardeola grayii</i>) on the south-eastern coast of India and a winter influx has also been noted in Sri Lanka.</p><p>Young birds are known to disperse up to 5,000\u00a0km (3,100\u00a0mi) from their breeding area. Flocks may fly vast distances and have been seen over seas and oceans including in the middle of the Atlantic.</p>\n\n<h2><span id=\"Breeding\">Breeding</span></h2>\n<p>The cattle egret nests in colonies, which are often found around bodies of water. The colonies are usually found in woodlands near lakes or rivers, in swamps, or on small inland or coastal islands, and are sometimes shared with other wetland birds, such as herons, egrets, ibises, and cormorants. The breeding season varies within South Asia. Nesting in northern India begins with the onset of monsoons in May. The breeding season in Australia is November to early January, with one brood laid per season. The North American breeding season lasts from April to October. In the Seychelles, the breeding season of  <i>B.i. seychellarum</i> is April to October.</p><p>The male displays in a tree in the colony, using a range of ritualised behaviours, such as shaking a twig and sky-pointing (raising his bill vertically upwards), and the pair forms over 3\u20134 days. A new mate is chosen in each season and when renesting following nest failure. The nest is a small, untidy platform of sticks in a tree or shrub constructed by both parents. Sticks are collected by the male and arranged by the female, and stick-stealing is rife. The clutch size can be  one to five eggs, although three or four is most common. The pale bluish-white eggs are oval-shaped and measure 45\u00a0mm \u00d7\u00a053\u00a0mm (1.8\u00a0in \u00d7\u00a02.1\u00a0in). Incubation lasts around 23\u00a0days, with both sexes sharing incubation duties. The chicks are partly covered with down at hatching, but are not capable of fending for themselves; they become capable of regulating their temperature at 9\u201312\u00a0days and are fully feathered in 13\u201321\u00a0days. They begin to leave the nest and climb around at 2\u00a0weeks, fledge at 30\u00a0days and become independent at around the 45th day.</p><p>The cattle egret engages in low levels of brood parasitism, and a few instances have been reported of cattle egret eggs being laid in the nests of snowy egrets and little blue herons, although these eggs seldom hatch. Also, evidence of low levels of intraspecific brood parasitism has been found, with females laying eggs in the nests of other cattle egrets. As much as 30% extra-pair copulations has been noted.</p><p>The dominant factor in nesting mortality is starvation. Sibling rivalry can be intense, and in South Africa, third and fourth chicks inevitably starve. In the dryer habitats with fewer amphibians, the diet may lack sufficient vertebrate content and may cause bone abnormalities in growing chicks due to calcium deficiency. In Barbados, nests were sometimes raided by vervet monkeys, and a study in Florida reported the fish crow and black rat as other possible nest raiders. The same study attributed some nestling mortality to brown pelicans nesting in the vicinity, which accidentally, but frequently, dislodged nests or caused nestlings to fall. In Australia, Torresian crows, wedge-tailed eagles, and white-bellied sea eagles take eggs or young, and tick infestation and viral infections may also be causes of mortality.</p>\n\n<h2><span id=\"Feeding\">Feeding</span></h2>\n\n<p>The cattle egret feeds on a wide range of prey, particularly insects, especially grasshoppers, crickets, flies (adults and maggots), and moths, as well as spiders, frogs, lizards and earthworms. In a rare instance, they have been observed foraging along the branches of a banyan tree for ripe figs. The species is usually found with cattle and other large grazing and browsing animals, and catches small creatures disturbed by the mammals. Studies have shown that cattle egret foraging success is much higher when foraging near a large animal than when feeding singly. When foraging with cattle, it has been shown to be 3.6\u00a0times more successful in capturing prey than when foraging alone. Its performance is similar when it follows farm machinery, but it is forced to move more. In urban situations, cattle egrets have also been observed foraging in peculiar situations such as railway lines.</p><p>A cattle egret will weakly defend the area around a grazing animal against others of the same species, but if the area is swamped by egrets, it will give up and continue foraging elsewhere. Where numerous large animals are present, cattle egrets selectively forage around species that move at around 5\u201315\u00a0steps per minute, avoiding faster and slower moving herds; in Africa, cattle egrets selectively forage behind plains zebras, waterbuck, blue wildebeest and Cape buffalo. Dominant birds feed nearest to the host, and thus obtain more food.</p><p>The cattle egret sometimes shows versatility in its diet. On islands with seabird colonies, it will prey on the eggs and chicks of terns and other seabirds. During migration, it has also been reported to eat exhausted migrating landbirds. Birds of the Seychelles race also indulge in some kleptoparasitism, chasing the chicks of sooty terns and forcing them to disgorge food.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Relationship_with_humans\">Relationship with humans</span></h2>\n\n<p>A conspicuous species, the cattle egret has attracted many common names. These mostly relate to its habit of following cattle and other large animals, and it is known variously as cow crane, cow bird or cow heron, or even elephant bird or rhinoceros egret. Its Arabic name, <i>abu qerdan</i>, means \"father of ticks\", a name derived from the huge number of parasites such as avian ticks found in its breeding colonies. The Maasai people consider the presence of large numbers of cattle egrets as an indicator of impending drought and use it to decide on moving their cattle herds.</p><p>The cattle egret is a popular bird with cattle ranchers for its perceived role as a biocontrol of cattle parasites such as ticks and flies. A study in Australia found that cattle egrets reduced the number of flies that bothered cattle by pecking them directly off the skin. It was the benefit to stock that prompted ranchers and the Hawaiian Board of Agriculture and Forestry to release the species in Hawaii.</p><p>Not all interactions between humans and cattle egrets are beneficial. The cattle egret can be a safety hazard to aircraft due to its habit of feeding in large groups in the grassy verges of airports, and it has been implicated in the spread of animal infections such as heartwater, infectious bursal disease, and possibly Newcastle disease.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Status\">Status</span></h2>\n<p>This species has a large range, with an estimated global extent of occurrence of 10,000,000\u00a0km<sup>2</sup> (3,900,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi). Its global population estimated to be 3.8\u20136.7\u00a0million individuals. For these reasons, the species is evaluated as least concern. The expansion and establishment of the species over large ranges, though, has led it to be classed as an invasive species (although little, if any impact has been noted yet).</p>\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n\n<h2><span id=\"External_links\">External links</span></h2>\n\n<ul><li> Media related to <span><i>Bubulcus ibis</i></span> at Wikimedia Commons</li>\n<li>Ageing and sexing (PDF) by Javier Blasco-Zumeta &amp; Gerd-Michael Heinze</li>\n<li>Cattle Egret - <i>The Atlas of Southern African Birds</i></li>\n<li>Cattle egret photo gallery at VIREO (Drexel University)</li></ul>\n\n<p class=\"mw-empty-elt\">\n</p>"

More informal or antiquated English common names include the <b>marsh hawk-eagle</b> or <b>Indian crested hawk-eagle</b>. It is a member of the booted eagle subfamily, with signature feathers, absent in tropical raptors from outside this subfamily, covering the tarsus. It was formerly placed in the genus <i>Spizaetus</i>, but studies pointed to the group being paraphyletic resulting in the Old World members being placed in <i>Nisaetus</i> (Hodgson, 1836) and separated from the New World species. It is a typical \u201chawk-eagle\u201d in that it is an agile forest-dwelling predator and like many such eagles readily varies its prey selection between birds, mammals or reptiles as well as other vertebrates. Among the members of its genus, the changeable hawk-eagle stands out as the most widely distributed, adaptable and abundant species.</p>\n\n\n<h2><span id=\"Systematics\">Systematics</span></h2>\n\n<p>The taxonomy of the wide-ranging changeable hawk-eagle is complex and confusing, with few authorities agreeing on whether the species in fact houses a species complex. Gamauf <i>et al.</i> (2005) analyzed mtDNA cytochrome <i>b</i> and control region sequence data of a considerable number of specimens of the crested hawk-eagle and some relatives. Despite the large sample, even the most conspicuous dichotomy - that between the crested and crestless groups - was not as well resolved as it might have been expected to be. At least one widely accepted genetic study has resulted in a recent revision to the recognition of a new species, as the Flores hawk-eagle has traditionally been treated as a subspecies of the changeable hawk-eagle, but it is now often treated as a separate species, <i>N. floris</i>. The Flores and changeable hawk-eagles are regarded as sister species.  The three small-island taxa (<i>N. c. andamanensis</i>, <i>N. c. vanheurni</i>, and <i>N. floris</i>) as a whole each appear as monophyletic lineages. Their placement is even more unresolved, with <i>N. floris</i> being apparently a very ancient lineage. The other two seem quite certainly to derive from <i>N. c. limnaeetus</i>. The latter taxon has a confusing phylogeny. Different lineages exist that are apparently not stable in space and time, are best described as polytomy, from which the similar island taxa derive. Obviously, <i>N. c. limnaeetus</i> does not represent a monophyletic lineage. Neither the biological nor the phylogenetic species concepts, nor phylogenetic systematics can be applied to satisfaction. The crested group apparently is close to becoming a distinct species. The island taxa derived from <i>N. c. limnaeetus</i> appear to have undergone founder effects, which has restricted their genetic diversity. In the continental population, genetic diversity is considerable, and the evolutionary pattern of the two studied genes did not agree, and neither did the origin of specimens show clear structures. <i>N. c. limnaeetus</i> thus is best considered a metapopulation.</p><p>Gamauf <i>et al.</i> (2005) therefore suggest the island taxa which are obviously at higher risk of extinction are, for conservation considered evolutionary significant units regardless of their systematic status. This case also demonstrates that a too-rigid interpretation of cladistics and the desire for monophyletic taxa, as well as universal application of single-species concept to all birds will undermine correct understanding of evolutionary relationships. It would even not be inconceivable to find mainland lineages to group closely with the western island taxa, if little genetic drift had occurred in the initial population. nonetheless, the divergence of this species' lineages seems to have taken place too recently to award them species status, as compared to the level of genetic divergence at which clades are usually considered distinct species. <i>N. c. limnaeetus</i> appears for all that can be said with reasonable certainty basal pool of lineages in the crestless group that, despite not being monophyletic, should be considered a valid taxon as long as gene flow is possible through its range. In addition, as ancient DNA from museum specimens was used extensively, the possibility of ghost lineages must be considered. If it is assumed that all or most of the ancient lineages still exist today, considerable recombination must have taken place as the two genes' phylogenies do not agree much, indicating a healthy level of gene flow. Whether this still holds true today remains to be determined.</p><p>Two distinct groups exist in the changeable hawk-eagle; one with crests and one without or with hardly visible crests. Dark morphs exist for some populations.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Subspecies\">Subspecies</span></h3>\n\n<p><b>Changeable hawk-eagle</b>\n</p>\n<ul><li><i>N. c. cirrhatus</i>: The nominate subspecies is found in the peninsular India, from the Gangetic plain southwards throughout the remainder of the country.  It is monomorphic in colour with no dark morph. The nominate subspecies is relatively pale above compared to other races, with a slightly more rufous hue to the head. It tends to be less extensively streaked below down to the lower breast below compared to other races, with dark wing lings and a strongly barred tail. In the juvenile plumage, the nominate race has a strongly buffy headed and has underparts that are flecked and spotted. The crest tends to be longest in this race, with common measurements of 10 to 14\u00a0cm (3.9 to 5.5\u00a0in) in length, therefore the race is commonly referred to as the crested hawk-eagle. It is one of the two larger subspecies. Wing chord length ranges from 405 to 442\u00a0mm (15.9 to 17.4\u00a0in) in males and from 448 to 462\u00a0mm (17.6 to 18.2\u00a0in) in females. In both sexes, the tail commonly measures 280 to 300\u00a0mm (11 to 12\u00a0in) and tarsus from 102 to 110\u00a0mm (4.0 to 4.3\u00a0in).</li>\n<li><i>N. c. ceylanensis</i>: This race is endemic to Sri Lanka but some authorities also include Travancore in the southern tip of India as part of this race's range. This race has a proportionally longer crest on average than the nominate race, with a similar crest length to it at about 10\u00a0cm (3.9\u00a0in). It is monomorphic as is the nominate race, averaging paler and less streaky, but a similar appearance has been noted to birds from southernmost India are rather similar in appearance. The differences represented in this race from the nominate race are largely clinal. It is rather smaller than the nominate race. Wing chord length ranges from 351 to 370\u00a0mm (13.8 to 14.6\u00a0in) in males and from 353 to 387\u00a0mm (13.9 to 15.2\u00a0in) in females.  Furthermore, in both sexes tail length is from 229 to 266\u00a0mm (9.0 to 10.5\u00a0in) and tarsus length from 89 to 97\u00a0mm (3.5 to 3.8\u00a0in).</li></ul><p><b>Crestless changeable hawk-eagle</b>\n</p>\n\n<ul><li><i>N. c. limnaeetus</i>: This race is found through the Himalayan foothills from Nepal, northeast India, via Burma to much of southeast Asia including the Malay Peninsula along Wallace Line to Philippines and the Greater Sunda Islands. This race can appear similar in size and build to the nominate race but unlike it is rather polymorphic and this is the most widely found of subspecies. This race's polymorphism is the source for the species being referred to as the changeable hawk-eagle. The pale morph of this race is still darker than the nominate race found further south in India. However, pale morphs from the Philippines tend to have a paler head and neck. Characteristically, this race is heavily streaked below, while juveniles look quite different as their head and underparts are largely white. Dark morph individuals tend to be chocolate-brown all over, although the tail base might appear lighter in flight. Some birds of this race do have a vestigial crest of merely 1 to 3\u00a0cm (0.39 to 1.18\u00a0in) in length but many appear to completely lack the crest. This race is generally similar in size to the nominate race but is more variable in size over its large distribution within the southernmost island birds averaging smallest while those found in the Himalayan foothills are arguably the largest hawk-eagles known in the species. Wing chord length ranges from 380 to 430\u00a0mm (15 to 17\u00a0in) in males and from 405 to 462\u00a0mm (15.9 to 18.2\u00a0in) in females. In limited samples, tail length was reported as 240 to 278\u00a0mm (9.4 to 10.9\u00a0in) and tarsus length from 100 to 103\u00a0mm (3.9 to 4.1\u00a0in).</li>\n<li><i>N. c. andamanensis</i>: This race is found in the Andaman Islands. The subspecies is darker than the nominate subspecies and more similar to <i>N. c. limnaeetus</i> in hue but does not appear to have a full dark morph as is known in that race. Andamanian juveniles tend to have a  rather white head and underpart colour. A crest may variably be present but is usually only up to 5\u00a0cm (2.0\u00a0in). This race is small, a little smaller even than <i>N. c. ceylanensis</i>. Wing chord length ranges from 330 to 375\u00a0mm (13.0 to 14.8\u00a0in) in males and from 358 to 377\u00a0mm (14.1 to 14.8\u00a0in) in females.</li>\n<li><i>N. c. vanheurni</i>: This race is native to Simeulue Island. It is similar in appearance to <i>N. c. limnaeetus</i>, but apparently lacks a dark morph. The subspecies is also much less heavily blotched black on its whiter looking breast and never bears a crest. It is the smallest accepted subspecies of the changeable hawk-eagle, considerably smaller than <i>N. c. limnaeetus</i>. Wing chord was measured as 312\u00a0mm (12.3\u00a0in) in a single male and 329 to 337\u00a0mm (13.0 to 13.3\u00a0in) in a small sample of females.</li></ul><h2><span id=\"Description\">Description</span></h2>\n\n<p>The changeable hawk-eagle is a largish but slender eagle. They fall near the middle of sizes among the currently accepted species in the genus <i>Nisaetus</i>. As in most birds of prey, females are larger than males with an average overall size difference of 7% but this can individually range to an 18-22% difference, with island races apparently thought to be less dimorphic on average.  Size is quite variable and total length has been reported in the past to vary from 51 to 82\u00a0cm (20 to 32\u00a0in) and wingspan from 100 to 160\u00a0cm (3\u00a0ft 3\u00a0in to 5\u00a0ft 3\u00a0in), however these figures appear to include the much more massive hawk-eagles from Flores that are currently considered their own separate species by modern authorities. Nonetheless, total lengths of up to 77\u00a0cm (30\u00a0in) have been listed for <i>N. c. limnaeetus</i> in Nepal. Ali &amp; Ripley (1978) estimated these average total lengths for the following subspecies: <i>N. c. cirrhatus</i> at 72\u00a0cm (28\u00a0in), <i>N. c. limnaeetus</i> at 70\u00a0cm (28\u00a0in) and <i>N. c. andamanensis</i> at 61\u00a0cm (24\u00a0in). Legge (1880) measured the length of Sri Lankan changeable hawk-eagles (<i>N. c. ceylanensis</i>) without including the beak as 55 to 60\u00a0cm (22 to 24\u00a0in). The average length of birds from the Philippines (<i>N. c. limnaeetus</i>) was measured as 58.4\u00a0cm (23.0\u00a0in) in males and 64.9\u00a0cm (25.6\u00a0in) in females. Weights in this species have been reported from 1.2 to 1.9\u00a0kg (2.6 to 4.2\u00a0lb) but the source of this is unclear and it probably underrepresents the size variation known to occur in the species.  The only precise body masses known for the species are derived from the Philippine population, where males were found to average 1.36\u00a0kg (3.0\u00a0lb) while females averaged 1.6\u00a0kg (3.5\u00a0lb) but they could weigh in excess of 1.81\u00a0kg (4.0\u00a0lb).</p>\n\n<p>Adult changeable hawk-eagles are typically dark brown above and boldly streaked below with a strong bill, a variably sized, often floppy crest or no crest, rather short wings, a quite long, thinly-barred tail and long feathered legs. This species tends to perch \u201cbolt\u201d upright, and may perch in various places from somewhat secluded spots to also quite open area as well. When perched, their wings reach only about one-third to halfway down tail. Pale morph adults are mainly dark brown above with very faint paler edges (usually only conspicuous on the wing-coverts). They tend to have an evenly black-streaked and somewhat rufous-tinged head and neck, with a blackish crest (if present). The tail tends to be paler brown than the back with a thin whitish tip, a broad, blackish subterminal band (both the whitish tip and the subterminal band are also visible from tail underside) and 3 to 4 narrower, brown and often rather obscure bars. On the pale morph hawk-eagle's underside, the base colour is white to buff overlaid with bold black to dark brown streaking; the streaking tends to be more subtle on abdomen but more obvious on the legs. Beyond the typical pale morph, some subspecies but especially <i>N. c. liminaeetus</i> tend to have a further intermediate and a dark morph. The intermediate morph is somewhat similar to pale morph adults but is heavily grey-brown below with little to no paler base colour showing and more obscure streaking, with the area from belly down to the crissum usually being unpatterned. Meanwhile, the dark morph adult can range from all dark chocolate brown to almost pure black with variable browner edges, relieved only by the greyish inner half of tail as well as some greyish tail bars. Most juvenile changeable hawk-eagles are dark brown above but with far more conspicuous white edges on mantle and wings than the adults, in some cases, the median coverts are largely white and greater and even lesser coverts are largely scaled with white. The juvenile has a light brown tail with about seven thin dark bars and a whitish tip. The young hawk-eagle's head varies from buff with white-tipped black crest (as is the case in peninsular India and Sri Lanka) through entirely whitish, but almost always the young birds are spotted and streaked with black or dark brown about the rear crown and nape. As is the head, the underparts are variable with juveniles in much of India and in Sri Lanka showing thin brown streaks on chest or small spots on breast, with obscure tawny barring on thigh, legs and crissum. Juveniles elsewhere are often nearly all pure whitish below. By the time the young hawk-eagles reaches their 2nd to 3rd year, they tend to show less white above and more brown or black below. Their tail starts to molt to resemble that of adults in the 3rd year but in the 2nd year in <i>N. c. limnaeetus</i> (or at least in Philippines). Changeable hawk-eagles may attempt to breed at 3 years of age but full adult plumage is not obtained until the 4th year. Adults have yellow to orange yellow eyes, while those of the juvenile are grey-brown to pale greenish. Adult have a cere that's grey to pale greenish yellow and juveniles\u2019 ceres are dull greyish, while all ages have yellow feet.</p>\n\n<p>In flight, the changeable hawk-eagles is a large raptor with a prominent head, rather short rounded and broad wings, longish squarish or rounded tail, but has somewhat slenderer wings and straighter trailing edges than sympatric species of hawk-eagles. The species tends to fly with a fast agile flight, showing powerful shallow beats interspersed with glides on flat or bowed wings with their carpals well forward (above level of bill) and primaries swept back. When soaring, the wings are gently lowered or sometimes held level, with the carpals again well forward. In pale morph adults in flight, their hand in flight may be variously dark brownish buff (as in peninsular India) to a much paler buff or whitish. On the flight feathers, the area from wingtips extending to the primary and secondary feathers often have blackish barring, forming ragged lines from the carpals to rear axillaries with variable other dark marks elsewhere. Adult intermediate morph hawk-eagles have similar flight feathers but have grey-brown underparts with a less distinct, contrasting underpattern. Meanwhile, in both juvenile and adult dark morph, the blackish-brown colour of the body extends to the hand but the base of their tail, their primaries and, less so, their secondaries are a much paler, contrasting grey with streaking similar to other changeable hawk-eagles. Typical juveniles show large areas of whitish streaking or mottling seen from above in flight. Juveniles from much of India and Sri Lanka show extensive darker tawny but obscure barring above and below, while other races are much whiter. Much like adult, the juvenile has dark tips to primary and greater coverts produce thin ragged diagonal bars but the barring tends to be thinner.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Voice\">Voice</span></h3>\n<p>The changeable hawk-eagle is often largely silent but in breeding season it may readily call, both from their perch or on the wing. Like many diurnal raptors, their calls are a form of high-pitched scream. The shrill ringing and loud call of the changeable hawk-eagle is various described in pattern of <i>yeep-yip-yip-yip</i>, rising <i>kwip-kwip-kwip-kwee-ah</i> and penetrating <i>klee-leeuw</i> (for birds from the Sunda islands). Ascending <i>kri-kri-kri-kree-ah</i> and <i>kreeee-krit</i> with much stress on the elongated first syllable are similar. From western birds  from India and Sri Lanka, the call is a slightly different <i>ki-ki-ki-ki-ki-ki-ki-keee</i>, beginning short, rising in crescendo and ending in long, drawn-out scream. In northern India and Malaysia, the calls of this species have variously been compared to those of the Eurasian curlew (<i>Numenius arquatus</i>) and the crested serpent eagle (<i>Spilornis cheela</i>).</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Confusion_species\">Confusion species</span></h3>\n\n<p>The changeable hawk-eagle is almost always the most common and/or most widely spread <i>Nisaetus</i> species anywhere in their range. Their distribution overlaps with the entirety of the distribution of the (newly recognized) Legge's hawk-eagle (<i>N. kelaarti</i>), most of the range of the Javan (<i>N. bartelsi</i>), Blyth's (<i>N. alboniger</i>) and Wallace's hawk-eagle (<i>N. nanus</i>) and partially overlaps with the ranges of the mountain hawk-eagle (<i>N. nipalensis</i>), the Philippine hawk-eagle (<i>N. philippinus</i>) (on Mindoro and possibly Palawan) and Pinsker's hawk-eagle (<i>N. pinskeri</i>) (on Mindanao). Only two species of the genus <i>Nisaetus</i> are outside the changeable hawk-eagle's normal distribution (including their own former subspecies, the Flores hawk-eagle). In range with most other <i>Nisaetus</i> species (such as the islands or mainland of southeast Asia), the changeable hawk-eagle is more likely to be almost crestless. Other species tend to have proportionately broader wings with more bulging secondaries, relatively shorter tails and, as adults, more barred underbody and unique tail patterns. Adult colour patterns can range from somewhat different to boldly distinct (especially in the black-and-white Blyth's hawk-eagle). Juveniles tend to be more difficult to distinguish but usually most other <i>Nisaetus</i> have less white showing than relevant changeable hawk-eagles and the changeable tends to show a slightly stronger V while in flight. The mountain hawk-eagle, Flores hawk-eagle (which is the only hawk-eagle in its small-island range) and Legge's hawk-eagle, in decreasing magnitude of size, are all are larger and bulkier than the changeable hawk-eagle whereas other <i>Nisaetus</i> species are smaller to varying degrees, distinctly so in the Wallace's hawk-eagle and Blyth's hawk-eagle. As many honey buzzards are thought to mimic more powerful raptors to protect themselves from predation, the crested honey buzzard (<i>Pernis ptilorhynchus</i>) is thought to mimic the general appearance of <i>Nisaetus</i> hawk-eagles but has a distinctly smaller head and longer and narrower wings than changeable hawk-eagles. Adult crested honey buzzards are barred but the juvenile is streaked rather like the changeable hawk-eagle, however if seen well the honey buzzard generally looks much more solidly orange-buffy as a base colour rather than whitish below. The flight actions of the honey buzzard are also distinct, with a more robotic even flap during flights. Juvenile crested serpent eagles, which are unlikely to be mistaken for the changeable other than at a distance and in flight, appear chunkier and less rangy with a bigger head, slightly longer wings and a substantially shorter tailed with fewer bars (these differences in proportions are generally applicable to various island serpent-eagle species that may be found with changeable hawk-eagles as well). Juvenile rufous-bellied eagles (<i>Lophotriorchis kienerii</i>) are rather smaller and more compact with a relatively longer winged and shorter tailed appearance. The rufous-bellied juvenile when compared to the juvenile changeable is generally purer white looking below which contrasts more strongly with their sparse blackish streaks. Dark morph changeable hawk-eagles may be confused with the similarly-sized but even more slender black eagle (<i>Ictinaetus malaiensis</i>). However, the latter is much longer winged with distinctly pinched-in bases, a uniformly dark tail and has small light feather bases only to primaries. Also dark morph can be told from dark morph booted eagles (<i>Hieraeetus pennatus</i>) by the latter being rather smaller, much shorter tailed and having relatively longer and more rectangular wings. Dark morph booted eagles are also grey-brown or cinnamon from below on the tail and have pale wedges on the underside of the primaries.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Distribution_and_habitat\">Distribution and habitat</span></h2>\n\n<p>The extensive range of the changeable hawk-eagle includes much of the Indian subcontinent and southeast Asia. Their distribution includes nations and areas such as Sri Lanka, Himalayan foothills (Garhwal to Assam), southern Nepal and Bhutan east through Myanmar, Burma, western Laos, southern Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand and peninsular Malaysia. In India, they may found almost continuously from the peninsular tip north to Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Odisha. Its island distribution includes the Andamans, Sumatra (including Simeulue and Mentawai off the west side and Riau, Bangka and Belitung off of the east), Java, Borneo and the western and southern Philippines (including Palawan, Calamians, Lubang, Mindoro, Mindanao and apparently recently Bohol). Like most tropical raptors, the changeable hawk-eagle is largely residential, but stragglers from peninsular India have roamed to northeastern Burma and southeastern Thailand and some records in the Lesser Sunda Islands (Bali, Palau and Lombok) may be from vagrants from Java. The species may live in savannah woodland, cultivation with trees, timbered watercourses, tea plantations, forest villages and even suburban edge. Beyond these often degraded haunts they range as well as any of the more forest-clinging <i>Nisaetus</i> into fairly open or less dense parts of undisturbed vast evergreen or deciduous forests (their deciduous ranges mainly occurring in India and the Sunda islands), but also second growth and wetlands. In elevation, they may be found anywhere from sea level to 2,200\u00a0m (7,200\u00a0ft) but mainly live below 1,500\u00a0m (4,900\u00a0ft). It is not uncommon in foothills of Sri Lanka but again does not usually exceed 1,500\u00a0m (4,900\u00a0ft) elevation there.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Ecology\">Ecology</span></h2>\n\n\n<p>Changeable hawk-eagles are at home in a variety of wooded and semi-open habitats. Their physical form and flight style is typical of forest-dwelling raptors in general and is often compared to the features of true hawks or <i>Accipiters</i> in particular larger species such as goshawks. Like most other forest raptors, changeable hawk-eagles (and <i>Nisaetus</i> species in general) have a long tail, short broad wings and relatively long but powerful legs, all of which impart greater maneuverability and quicker strike times in denser wooded hunting grounds than other raptorial body plans. The common name hawk-eagle is apparently in reference to their similar adaptations to true hawks. Even compared to the variable prey of large goshawks, the prey selection of changeable hawk-eagles appears to be somewhat indiscriminate and opportunistic. Unfortunately, compared to tropical raptors from the neotropics and especially Africa, the life histories of raptors from tropical Asia are generally quite poorly-known, even in the case of easily observed raptors such as changeable hawk-eagles. Therefore, what is known of changeable hawk-eagles dietary biology is largely drawn together based on reliable eye-witness and anecdotal accounts, photographic evidence and wide-ranging bird census surveys, rather than direct, extensive study. The changeable hawk-eagle can show a slight preference for birds as prey, but also freely takes various mammals, reptiles and some other vertebrates whenever they opportune upon them. Although little quantitative analysis has gone into their dietary habits, many prey items taken are relatively small. On the other hand, Brown &amp; Amadon (1986) description of this species as \u201cnot a very rapacious bird\u201d is not entirely justified as extremely large prey relative to the hawk-eagle's size may also be readily taken. Like many tropical forest raptors, they are primarily ambush predators who use concealing foliage to still-hunt from hidden branch or open branch with a leafy background, pouncing fast to take most of their prey on the ground. Like goshawks, changeable hawk-eagles often perch-hunts which are short, low-level flights from perch to perch interspersed with brief pauses, during which they scan for potential prey. Perch-hunting lends them the greatest success when hunting birds that they will capture in the trees. At least a few cases have been observed of changeable hawk-eagles watching for and then dropping on prey directly from their own nest.</p>\n\n<p>One of the only general analysis of the quantitative food preferences of the changeable hawk-eagle (although detailed prey analysis, including prey species, was not specified), was a study of this species in contrast with five other raptor species in the Maharashtra state of India. This showed that they had a preference for birds as prey, with nearly equal number of birds classified as small or large making up nearly half of their diet in 14 active territories. Furthermore, their prey selection was found to be somewhat similar by class to that of Bonelli's eagle (<i>Aquila fasciata</i>), an eagle of much more open and rocky habitats, but the changeable hawk-eagle took the highest class diversity of prey of any of the six raptors studied and was the only one to hunt near heavily wooded areas. Primary prey by class differed in West Java, where 62% of prey selected was reptiles, 24% birds and 12% mammals. Elsewhere in India, prey selection at the nest showed what prey species were selected by changeable hawk-eagles but lacked any quantitative data or studies on prey biomass. One study in Gujarat showed several rather small prey species largely being taken such as the Indian chameleon (<i>Chamaeleo zeylanicus</i>), Oriental garden lizard (<i>Calotes versicolor</i>), other lizards, common myna (<i>Acridotheres tristis</i>), red-vented bulbul (<i>Pycnonotus cafer</i>), other birds (including unidentified parakeets and gamebirds), Indian bush rat (<i>Golunda ellioti</i>) and a palm squirrel. The identified prey would vary in size only from 35\u00a0g (1.2\u00a0oz) for a garden lizard to 117\u00a0g (4.1\u00a0oz) for a myna with the small lizards and chameleons reportedly the most often delivered prey. In Mudumalai National Park, only three prey types were specified to genera which consisted of black-hooded oriole (<i>Orolus xanthornus</i>), common bronzeback snake (<i>Dendrelaphis tristis</i>) and an unidentified giant squirrel. Not all nests have relatively small prey, as one nest in northern India showed a prey composition of red junglefowl (<i>Gallus gallus</i>), large woodpeckers such as flamebacks and larger parakeets. Alongside various junglefowl and the domestic chicken derived from them, virtually any gamebird seem to be nearly ideal prey for changeable hawk-eagles and several species, including peafowl, bush quail, spurfowl and francolins, are known to be hunted, including both young and adults. Many other birds with partial terrestrial habits seem to be taken quite widely including various pigeons and doves, rails and other water birds.</p>\n\n<p>The upper size limit for changeable hawk-eagle prey seems to be fairly liquid and the species is quite the equal of various other booted eagles in making bold attacks on prey of their own size or larger. Many of the mammals reported as preyed upon by changeable hawk-eagles are quite large. Mammalian prey taken as adults has included hispid hares (<i>Lepus hispidus</i>) with a median estimated weight of 2.35\u00a0kg (5.2\u00a0lb), Indian hare (<i>Lepus nigricollis</i>) with a median mass of 2.7\u00a0kg (6.0\u00a0lb), 1.3\u00a0kg (2.9\u00a0lb) Indian flying fox (<i>Pteropus giganteus</i>) and nearly any species of giant squirrel, which can vary in weight between 1.1 and 3\u00a0kg (2.4 and 6.6\u00a0lb). Even more impressive accounts and photos show that changeable hawk-eagle can hunt and kill adult mammals with formidable defenses such as felids and primates, although it cannot be ruled out that they will usually attack infirm or injured specimens rather than healthy ones. Furthermore, most accounts of attacks on Old World monkeys show juveniles are by far the most vulnerable members of their troops to hawk-eagle attacks. Cases of either verified, likely or potential predation have been reported on northern pig-tailed macaque (<i>Macaca leonina</i>), crab-eating macaque (<i>Macaca fascicularis</i>), toque macaque (<i>Macaca sinica</i>) and lion-tailed macaque (<i>Macaca silenus</i>), including specimens potentially to weigh up to an estimated 6\u00a0kg (13\u00a0lb). A case of predation was photographed by a changeable hawk-eagle on an estimated 1.9\u00a0kg (4.2\u00a0lb) juvenile banded langur (<i>Presbytis femoralis</i>) while possible cases have been reported of predation on juveniles of other langurs as well as additional larger primates such as gibbons and proboscis monkeys (<i>Nasalis larvatus</i>). While their predator-prey relationship is even more nebulous, the peculiar, smaller but toxic nocturnal primates known as slow lorises are known to fall prey as well to changeable hawk-eagles. There are several accounts of predation by changeable hawk-eagles on domestic cats (<i>Felis silvestris catus</i>), though largely kittens, in addition to a case of a large adult jungle cat (<i>Felis chaus</i>), with an estimated median weight of 7.3\u00a0kg (16\u00a0lb), being attacked and killed by one of these hawk-eagles. Apparently, the changeable hawk-eagle is also counted among the predators of young calves of Indian gazelles (<i>Gazella bennetti</i>) as well. Adults of large monitor lizards of a few species may be also included in their prey spectrum. Impressive avian kills have included adult Indian peafowl (<i>Pavo cristatus</i>), of an estimated weight of up to 4\u00a0kg (8.8\u00a0lb), and the species is considered a threat as well to the similar green peafowl (<i>Pavo muticus</i>). Attempted predation on both 4.2\u00a0kg (9.3\u00a0lb) adult and young giant ibis (<i>Thaumatibis gigantea</i>) have been recorded but all known attacks were unsuccessful. Cases of scavenging on carcasses of various deer and monkey have been reported as well, in one case a hawk-eagle was filmed apparently dominating and displacing an adult yellow-throated marten (<i>Martes flavigula</i>) from a carcass.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Interspecies_predatory_relationships\">Interspecies predatory relationships</span></h3>\n<p>The habitat selection and overall distribution of the changeable hawk-eagle is largely concurrent with other largish raptors such as the crested serpent eagle and the crested honey buzzard, apparently the three species are largely tolerant and non-aggressive towards each other, perhaps surprisingly given the otherwise aggressive habits of hawk-eagles. Unsurprisingly, these species have quite discrepant ecological niches, especially in terms of their dietary habits. Although nest predators are probably profuse, parent changeable hawk-eagles are likely to aggressive displace most potential threats. No verified accounts of predation are known in the wild and the species often likely fulfills the role of an apex predator. They are presumably able to persist alongside larger cousins such as mountain hawk-eagles and with Legge's hawk-eagle by focusing more so on reptiles and birds rather than the mammalian prey likely preferred by the larger species (as well as perhaps focusing primarily on a smaller class of prey), although it is somewhat more adaptable in habitat than both other species. They are also found living alongside the much larger Philippine eagle (<i>Pithecophaga jefferyi</i>) and are likely to similarly take smaller prey and avoid direct encounters with the much less numerous giant eagle. In turn, changeable hawk-eagles are likely avoided in encounters with smaller forest raptors such as other, smaller <i>Nisaetus</i> species, which often focus slightly less on birds than the changeable, and <i>Accipiter</i> hawks, which all subsist largely on rather smaller classes of prey. Apparently, changeable hawk-eagle are considered likely predators (on fledglings?) of the slightly smaller Indian spotted eagles (<i>Clanga hastata</i>). However, on the contrary, one case of predation was reported in captivity when a barred eagle-owl (<i>Bubo sumatranus</i>), which is found in the wild with changeable hawk-eagles in southeast Asia, killed a changeable hawk-eagle in an aviary.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Breeding\">Breeding</span></h2>\n<p>The changeable hawk-eagle is, like many raptorial birds, a largely solitary bird otherwise but during breeding, stays in a dedicated pairs that often mate for life. Each pair engages in a territorial display over the fringes of their home range. This aerial display is usually engaged in by a male but sometimes the female or both members of the pair will engage in displays, often starting with their wings and tail arched upwards in exaggerated poises. During the display, the shoot up vertically and nose-diving or stooping, if the rival hawk-eagle continues to engage the defending individual, they will fly at each other at \"lightening speed\" doing a complete loop-the-loop turn in air. They often call loudly throughout the display. The breeding season of changeable hawk-eagles falls from November to May in southern India, peaking January\u2013March, while it is more confined to January\u2013April in the more temperate climate of the Himalayan foothills. The breeding season from India is comparable in Sri Lanka but is slightly more prolonged in the latter country, continuing at times into June. However, peak laying dates fall earlier, around January\u2013February, in Sri Lanka. In the equatorial Greater Sunda islands, eggs have been recorded in 8 different months at any time from December to October with peak activity falling usually between February and August. Apparently, the highest volume of eggs laid here fall in two separate periods, February\u2013March and July\u2013August. Thus, the breeding season is more elastic in tropical forests areas but in northern part of range the breeding season centers around the cooler dry season.  This species builds a largish stick nest. Typical dimensions of their nest is 95 to 105\u00a0cm (37 to 41\u00a0in) across while nest depth can range from 35 to 120\u00a0cm (14 to 47\u00a0in) the latter after repeated uses and additions. Some nests are very large relative to the size of these eagles. One nest reached an diameter on the inside of 1.3\u00a0m (4.3\u00a0ft) and a circumference of 3.45\u00a0m (11.3\u00a0ft). Active nests are lined with green leaves. Both members of the pair participate in building new nests and take part in repairs. Nests are often solidly built and resilient, more so than those of other medium-sized eagles, against high winds and monsoons. Nest height is often from 6 to 50\u00a0m (20 to 164\u00a0ft) in the crown or high fork of a large tree, but is usually not less than 12\u00a0m (39\u00a0ft) off the ground. Nest height in the Indian subcontinent was typically around 12 to 25\u00a0m (39 to 82\u00a0ft), averaging 17\u00a0m (56\u00a0ft) in the Shoolpaneshwar Wildlife Sanctuary and 19\u00a0m (62\u00a0ft) in the Indo-Gangetic Plain, and could be in a wide diversity of trees. Nesting sites are often near a stream, or otherwise perhaps near a ravine with wide view but sometimes varies from deep forest to isolated trees on village edges. In the peri-urban green spaces of Singapore, changeable hawk-eagles nested mostly on <i>Albizia</i> trees, which are among the fastest-growing and tallest trees in these secondary forests. The parents tend to allow closer approach by humans when living in vicinity of villages.</p><p>Only one egg is known to be laid by changeable hawk-eagles. The egg tends to be coarse and glossless, largely white but sparely and faintly speckled or blotched with light reddish. Egg sizes were reportedly measured in the nominate subspecies (sample of 40) as ranging from 65.3 to 73\u00a0mm (2.57 to 2.87\u00a0in) in height with an average of 68\u00a0mm (2.7\u00a0in) by a diameter of 49.9 to 53.3\u00a0mm (1.96 to 2.10\u00a0in) with an average of 52\u00a0mm (2.0\u00a0in). In the race <i>N. c. ceylanensis</i>, a sample of 24 eggs averaged 61.3\u00a0mm \u00d7\u00a049.8\u00a0mm (2.41\u00a0in \u00d7\u00a01.96\u00a0in). In <i>N. c. limnaeetus</i> from northern India, 18 eggs averaged 69.8\u00a0mm \u00d7\u00a051.6\u00a0mm (2.75\u00a0in \u00d7\u00a02.03\u00a0in). In the same subspecies, eggs from Java and Borneo ranged from 61 to 68.8\u00a0mm (2.40 to 2.71\u00a0in) in height and from 50 to 54\u00a0mm (2.0 to 2.1\u00a0in) in diameter. In the race <i>N. c. andamanensis</i>, the average was reportedly 62.2\u00a0mm \u00d7\u00a050.1\u00a0mm (2.45\u00a0in \u00d7\u00a01.97\u00a0in) but the sample size is unknown. Apparently, the female alone incubates, for a period estimated at about 40 days. After the nestling hatches, the female will brood intensively for about 25 days. An Indian nestling was found to weigh 300\u00a0g (0.66\u00a0lb) at 14 days and grew to 450\u00a0g (0.99\u00a0lb) by 20 days, having developed a vocabulary of <i>cheep</i> notes to express hunger and alarm. The eaglet may be preening, standing more and wing flapping by 4 to 5 weeks old, and may also be encouraged to eat at by its mother, however consuming a single food item may take up to 6 hours at this point. At 35 days, the nestling may be brooded progressively less and feather and body size growth accelerates. Within in a couple weeks, prey is delivered (often by both parents at this stage) to nearby branches rather than directly to the nest with the parents calling as they approach, apparently encouraging the young eaglet to venture out of the nest. By 52 days of age, the eaglet is fully-grown but does not fledge until about 60\u201368 days. The total nest dependency was recorded as 81 days in India. However, the total breeding cycle was recorded as lasting about 112 days in West Java.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Status\">Status</span></h2>\n\n<p>The changeable hawk-eagle apparently ranges over 13 million square kilometers across its range. An average of only 1 pair to every 1,200\u00a0km (750\u00a0mi) of its distribution would put the population well into five figures but their density is likely rather higher. This species is an exceptionally adaptable one not only by the standards of its genus but also by the standards of its subfamily. While deforestation has depleted the populations of their fellow <i>Nisaetus</i> species, resulting in four being classified as Endangered species, the changeable hawk-eagle has been shown to be remarkably resilient in the face of cutting and habitat degradation. This trend, holding steady in population or even increasing while other hawk-eagle species have declined, has been reported in the Indian subcontinent, Malaysia, Java and the Philippines as well as elsewhere in southeast Asia. In Java, the changeable hawk-eagle was found to persist in all seven habitat types available on the islands, whereas the Javan hawk-eagle was confined to only four habitat types: the deeper, primary forested areas. However, their adaptability can be overstated and this species requires tall trees (though secondary growth forest is acceptable), appropriate habitat composition and ample prey populations to flourish. It is likely they can persist in most variety of high grade forestry and urbanization but complete deforestation is the only major threat to this species. A more secondary concern, but potentially depleting populations in India at least, is that it will not infrequently hunt chickens (especially during breeding when such easy prey is hard to resist), which has in turn resulted in changeable hawk-eagles being locally persecuted.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n\n<h2><span id=\"Further_reading\">Further reading</span></h2>\n<ul><li>Ali, Salim &amp; Daniel, J.C.

The specific <i>fucata</i> is Latin for \"painted\"  from <i>fucare</i>, \"to paint red\".</p>\n\n\n<h2><span id=\"Description\">Description</span></h2>\n<p>It is 15 to 16\u00a0cm in length. The plumage is mostly brown with dark streaks. The male has a grey crown and nape with dark streaks, chestnut ear-coverts and bands of black and chestnut across the breast. There is a rufous patch on the shoulders and the rump is also rufous. Females are similar to the males but duller with a less distinct head and breast pattern. First-winter birds are plainer but show warm brown ear-coverts and have an obvious ring around the eye.\n</p><p>Its voice is similar to the rustic bunting but quieter. The song is a rapid twittering which begins with staccato notes and then accelerates before ending with a distinctive two or three note phrase. The call is an explosive <i>pzick</i>.\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Distribution_and_habitat\">Distribution and habitat</span></h2>\n<p>The breeding range extends from the Himalayas locally across China to south-eastern Siberia, Korea and northern Japan. Northern birds migrate south to winter in southern Japan, southern China, Taiwan, north-eastern India, Bangladesh and Southeast Asia.\n The species is a vagrant to Kazakhstan and in October 2004 the first European record occurred at Fair Isle in Scotland. Preferred habitats include scrub, fields and grassland.\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Reproduction\">Reproduction</span></h2>\n<p>The cup-shaped nest is built at ground level or low in a bush. Three to six eggs are laid with four being most common. These are whitish with reddish-brown speckling and are incubated for 12 days.

They may also make use of hollows on buildings. The nest is built mainly by the female, but males may sometimes assist. The female alone incubates the eggs, sometimes leaving the nest during the hotter parts of the day. The eggs hatch after about 12 to 14 days.</p><p>They roost communally in low bushes.

It is a resident or partially migratory species found in wooded habitats in India and Southeast Asia. The species name is after the distribution of a former subspecies in the Malabar region. While the chestnut-tailed starling is a winter visitor to peninsular India, the closely related resident breeding population with a white head is now treated as a full species, the Malabar starling (<i>Sturnia blythii</i>).\n</p>\n\n\n<h2><span id=\"Taxonomy_and_distribution\">Taxonomy and distribution</span></h2>\n<p>The lack of monophyly in the earlier starling genera has led to this species being placed variously under genus <i>Sturnia</i>, <i>Sturnus</i> and <i>Temenuchus</i> in the past (Zuccon <i>et al.</i>, 2006) and studies have suggested the reuse of an old name <i>Temenuchus</i> for members of this clade.

As <i>S. m. malabarica</i> only visits the range of <i>blythii</i> during the non-breeding period (winter), the two are not known to interbreed. However, a molecular study found the genetic divergence between <i>S. blythii</i> not significantly greater (between 0.2% and 0.8%) than between the sisters <i>S. m. malabarica</i> of northern India and <i>S. m. nemoricola</i> of Burma and Vietnam.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Description\">Description</span></h2>\n\n<p>The adults have a total length of approximately 20\u00a0cm (7.9\u00a0in). They have grey upperparts and blackish remiges, but the colour of the remaining plumage depends on the subspecies. In the nominate subspecies and <i>blythii</i>, the underparts (incl. undertail) are rufous, but in <i>nemoricola</i> the underparts are whitish tinged rufous, especially on the flanks and crissum (the undertail coverts surrounding the cloaca). The nominate and <i>nemoricola</i> have a light grey head with whitish streaking (especially on crown and collar region). Both subspecies have white irises and a yellow bill with a pale blue base. The sexes are similar, but juveniles have whitish underparts and just chestnut tips to the tail feathers.\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Behaviour\">Behaviour</span></h2>\n<p>The chestnut-tailed starling's nest is typically found in open woodland and cultivation.

The Chinese rubythroat was subsequently considered as a subspecies of the Himalayan rubythroat (<i>Calliope pectoralis</i>). The species complex was given the English name \"white-tailed rubythroat\" and placed in the genus <i>Luscinia</i>.  A large molecular phylogenetic study published in 2010 found that the <i>Luscinia</i> was not monophyletic. The genus was therefore split and several species including the white-tailed rubythroat were moved to the reinstated genus <i>Calliope</i>. Another study published in 2016 compared the mitochondrial DNA, vocalization and morphology of several <i>Calliope pectoralis</i> subspecies. Based on their results the authors recommended that <i>C. p. tschebaiewi</i> be promoted to species rank with the English name Chinese rubythroat.

During the breeding season the male sings through the day from the top of an exposed perch. The song is a series of squeaky notes with a great deal of variation. Females produce an upward inflected whistle that follows a short and gruff note. The alarm call is a sharp yapping <i>skyap</i>.</p><p>In the Tien Shan region, the Chinese rubythroat is found in thickets of juniper elfin at altitudes of 2500 to 2700 m on gently sloping land. The breeding season is in summer and nests are built in shrubs near dense stands of trees. The nest is placed in the middle of a shrub and sometimes on the ground in a dense tussock. The typical nest is a loose and large ball like with an entrance on the side but is sometimes cup like with an open top. The nest is built mainly by the female. A clutch of 4 to 6 eggs is laid. The eggs are greenish blue with rusty dots forming a ring near the broad end. Incubation is mostly by the female but the nestlings are fed by both parents. The eggs hatch after around 14 days and the young leave the nest when they fledge after about 16 days. The parents forage close to the nest and the young are mainly fed with hairy caterpillars. Rubythroats have been observed to abandon their nest when a cuckoo (<i>Cuculus canorus</i>) laid an egg in their nest. Martens and stoats sometimes destroy nests and prey on the young.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>"

This species was formerly considered a subspecies of the Indian spot-billed duck and both were referred to as the spot-billed duck (<i>A. poecilorhyncha</i>). The name is derived from the yellow spot on the bill.\n</p>\n\n\n<h2><span id=\"Taxonomy\">Taxonomy</span></h2>\n\n<p>The eastern spot-billed duck was described by the English biologist Robert Swinhoe in 1866 under its current binomial name <i>Anas zonorhyncha</i>. The name of the genus <i>Anas</i> is the Latin word for a duck. The specific epithet <i>zonorhyncha</i> is derived from the classical Greek words <i>z\u014dn\u0113</i> meaning \"band\" or \"girdle\" and <i>rhunkhos</i> meaning \"bill\".</p><p>Historically, the eastern spot-billed duck was usually considered as a subspecies of the Indian spot-billed duck (<i>A. poecilorhyncha</i>). The American ornithologist Bradley Livezey in a morphological study of the dabbling ducks published in 1991 proposed that the eastern spot-billed duck should be promoted to species status. Subsequently, fieldwork conducted at Hong Kong in southern China found that although both the eastern spot-billed duck and the Indian spot-billed duck (subspecies <i>A. poecilorhyncha haringtoni</i>) bred in the region at the same time, mixed pairs were only very rarely observed. Base on this observation, the American Ornithologists' Union recognised the eastern spot-billed duck as a separate species in 2008. Most taxonomists now treat the eastern spot-billed duck as a separate species. There is also some degree of hybridization with the mallard in the wild in eastern Russia with a tendency for a greater ratio of male eastern spot-billed ducks to mate with female mallards than the other way round.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Description\">Description</span></h2>\n\n<p>This duck is around the same size as a mallard and has a scaly patterned body with a blue speculum. At rest the long neck and the bill with the yellow tip are distinctive. It measures 55\u201363\u00a0cm (22\u201325\u00a0in) in length and 83\u201395\u00a0cm (33\u201337\u00a0in) across the wings, with a body mass of 790\u20131,500\u00a0g (1.74\u20133.31\u00a0lb). These are mainly grey ducks with a paler head and neck and a black bill tipped bright yellow. The wings are whitish with black flight feathers below, and from above show a white-bordered green. The male does not have an eclipse plumage. Juveniles are browner and duller than adults. The legs and feet are bright orange.</p><p>The eastern spot-billed duck is darker and browner than the Indian spot-billed duck; its body plumage is more similar to the Pacific black duck. It lacks the red bill spot, and has a blue speculum.</p><p>Both males and females undergo a complete postnuptial moult, dropping all their wing feathers simultaneously.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Distribution\">Distribution</span></h2>\n<p>The eastern spot-billed duck is migratory, wintering in Southeast Asia. It is quite gregarious outside the breeding season and forms small flocks. The populations in Japan and the Russian Far East have expanded their range northwards by more than 500\u00a0km since the early 20th century, possibly in reaction to global warming.</p><p>It is a bird of freshwater lakes and marshes in fairly open country and feeds by dabbling for plant food mainly in the evening or at night. The breeding season varies with rainfall and water condition but normally between April and July. It nests on the ground in vegetation near water. The clutch is usually 7-9 eggs. Incubation begins after the last egg is laid (allowing the chicks to hatch simultaneously) and the young hatch after about 24 days. The chicks are black with a yellow back and resemble those of mallards but with a wider eyestripe.</p><p>Both the male and female have calls similar to the mallard.\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Gallery\">Gallery</span></h2>\n<ul class=\"gallery mw-gallery-traditional\"><li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\">\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\">\n</ul><h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n\n<h2><span id=\"External_links\">External links</span></h2>\n<ul><li>Xeno-canto: audio recordings of the eastern spot-billed duck</li>\n<li>Bird Research - Eastern Spot-billed Duck</li></ul>"

It is also known as the <b>black vulture</b>, <b>monk vulture</b>, or <b>Eurasian black vulture</b>. It is a member of the family Accipitridae, which also includes many other diurnal raptors such as kites, buzzards and harriers. It is one of the two largest Old World vultures, attaining a maximum size of 14\u00a0kg, (roughly 30\u00a0lbs), 1.2 m long (almost 4\u00a0ft) and 3.1 m (a bit over 10\u00a0ft) across the wings.\n</p>\n\n\n<h2><span id=\"Taxonomy\">Taxonomy</span></h2>\n<p>The genus name <i>Aegypius</i> is a Greek word (\u03b1\u1f30\u03b3\u03c5\u03c0\u03b9\u03cc\u03c2) for 'vulture', or a bird not unlike one; Aelian describes the <i>aegypius</i> as \"halfway between a vulture (<i>gyps</i>) and an eagle\". Some authorities think this a good description of a lammergeier; others do not. Aegypius is the eponym of the species, whatever it was in ancient Greek. The English name 'black vulture' refers to the plumage colour, while 'monk vulture', a direct translation of its German name M\u00f6nchsgeier, refers to the bald head and ruff of neck feathers like a monk's cowl. 'Cinereous vulture' (Latin <i>cineraceus</i>, ash-coloured; pale, whitish grey), was a deliberate attempt to rename it with a new name distinct from the American black vulture.</p><p>This bird is an Old World vulture, and as such is only distantly related to the New World vultures, which are in a separate family, Cathartidae, of the same order. It is, therefore, not closely related to the much smaller American black vulture (<i>Coragyps atratus</i>) despite the similar name and coloration.\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Description\">Description</span></h2>\n\n\n<p>The cinereous vulture measures 98\u2013120\u00a0cm (3\u00a0ft 3\u00a0in\u20133\u00a0ft 11\u00a0in) in total length with a 2.5\u20133.1\u00a0m (8\u00a0ft 2\u00a0in\u201310\u00a0ft 2\u00a0in) wingspan. Males can weigh from 6.3 to 11.5\u00a0kg (14 to 25\u00a0lb), whereas females can weigh from 7.5 to 14\u00a0kg (17 to 31\u00a0lb). It is thus one of the world's heaviest flying birds. Average weights are not known to have been published for this species but the median weight figures from two sources were 9.42\u00a0kg (20.8\u00a0lb) and 9.55\u00a0kg (21.1\u00a0lb). Unlike most accipitrids, males can broadly overlap in size with the females, although not uncommonly the females may be slightly heavier. These are one of the two largest extant Old World vultures and accipitrids, with similar total length and perhaps wingspans recorded in the Himalayan vulture (<i>Gyps himalayensis</i>) , as indicated by broadly similar wing and tail proportions, but the cinereous appears to be slightly heavier as well as slightly larger in tarsus and bill length. Superficially similar but unrelated New World condors can either be of similar wing area and bulk or slightly larger in these aspects.  Despite limited genetic variation in the species, body size increases from west to east based on standard measurements, with the birds from southwest Europe (Spain and south France) averaging about 10% smaller than the vultures from central Asia (Manchuria, Mongolia and northern China). Among standard measurements, the wing chord is 73\u201389\u00a0cm (29\u201335\u00a0in), the tail is 33\u201341\u00a0cm (13\u201316\u00a0in) and the tarsus is 12\u201314.6\u00a0cm (4.7\u20135.7\u00a0in).</p><p>The cinereous vulture is distinctly dark, with the whole body being brown excepting the pale head in adults, which is covered in fine blackish down. This down is absent in the closely related lappet-faced vulture (<i>Torgos tracheliotos</i>). The skin of the head and neck is bluish-gray and a paler whitish color above the eye. The adult has brown eyes, a purplish cere, a blue-gray bill and pale blue-gray legs. The primary quills are often actually black. From a distance, flying birds can easily appear all black. The immature plumage is sepia-brown above, with a much paler underside than in adults. Immature cinereous vultures have grey down on the head, a pale mauve cere and grey legs. The massive bill is the largest of any living accipiterid, a feature enhanced by the relatively small skull of the species. The exposed culmen of the cinereous vulture measures 8\u20139\u00a0cm (3.1\u20133.5\u00a0in). The wings, with serrated leading edges, are held straight or slightly arched in flight and are broad, sometimes referred to as \"barn door wings\". Their flight is slow and buoyant, with deep, heavy flaps when necessary. The combination of huge size and dark coloration renders the cinereous vulture relatively distinct, especially against smaller raptors such as eagles or buzzards. The most similar-shaped species, the lappet-faced vulture (with which there might be limited range overlap in the southern Middle East), is distinguished by its bare, pinkish head and contrasting plumage. On the lappet-face, the thighs and belly are whitish in adult birds against black to brownish over the remainder of the plumage. All potential <i>Gyps</i> vultures are distinguished by having paler, often streaky plumage, with bulging wing primaries giving them a less evenly broad-winged form. Cinereous vultures are generally very silent, with a few querulous mewing, roaring or guttural cries solely between adults and their offspring at the nest site.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Distribution_and_habitat\">Distribution and habitat</span></h2>\n\n\n<p>The cinereous vulture is a Eurasian species. The western limits of its range are in Spain and inland Portugal, with a reintroduced population in south France. They are found discontinuously to Greece, Turkey and throughout the central Middle East. Their range continues through Afghanistan eastwards to northern India to its eastern limits in central Asia, where they breed in northern Manchuria, Mongolia and Korea. Their range is fragmented especially throughout their European range. It is generally a permanent resident except in those parts of its range where hard winters cause limited altitudinal movement and for juveniles when they reach breeding maturity. In the eastern limits of its range, birds from the northernmost reaches may migrate down to southern Korea and China. A limited migration has also been reported in the Middle East but is not common.</p><p>This vulture is a bird of hilly, mountainous areas, especially favoring dry semi-open habitats such as meadows at high altitudes over much of the range. Nesting usually occurs near the tree line in the mountains. They are always associated with undisturbed, remote areas with limited human disturbance. They forage for carcasses over various kinds of terrain, including steppe, grasslands, open woodlands, along riparian habitats or any kind of mountainous habitat. In their current European range and through the Caucasus and Middle East, cinereous vultures are found from 100 to 2,000\u00a0m (330 to 6,560\u00a0ft) in elevation, while in their Asian distribution, they are typically found at higher elevations. Two habitat types were found to be preferred by the species in China and Tibet. Some cinereous vultures in these areas live in mountainous forests and shrubland from 800 to 3,800\u00a0m (2,600 to 12,500\u00a0ft), while the others preferred arid or semi-arid alpine meadows and grasslands at 3,800 to 4,500\u00a0m (12,500 to 14,800\u00a0ft) in elevation. This species can fly at a very high altitude. One cinereous vulture was observed at an elevation of 6,970\u00a0m (22,870\u00a0ft) on Mount Everest. It has a specialised haemoglobin alpha<sup>D</sup> subunit of high oxygen affinity which makes it possible to take up oxygen efficiently despite the low partial pressure in the upper troposphere. Juvenile and immature cinereous vultures, especially those in the northern stretches of the species range, may move large distances across undeveloped open-dry habitats in response to snowfall or high summer temperatures.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Behaviour\">Behaviour</span></h2>\n\n\n<p>The cinereous vulture is a largely solitary bird, being found alone or in pairs much more frequently than most other Old World vultures. At large carcasses or feeding sites, small groups may congregate. Such groups can rarely include up to 12 to 20 vultures, with some older reports of up to 30 or 40.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Breeding\">Breeding</span></h3>\n\n<p>In Europe, the cinereous vulture return to the nesting ground in January or February. In Spain and Algeria, they start nesting in February in March, in Crimea in early March, in northwestern India in February or April, in northeastern India in January, and in Turkestan in January. They breed in loose colonies, with nests rarely being found in the same tree or rock formation, unlike other Old World vultures which often nest in tight-knit colonies. In Spain, nests have been found from 300\u00a0m (980\u00a0ft) to 2\u00a0km (6,600\u00a0ft) apart from each other. The cinereous vulture breeds in high mountains and large forests, nesting in trees or occasionally on cliff ledges. The breeding season lasts from February until September or October. The most common display consists of synchronous flight movements by pairs. However, flight play between pairs and juveniles is not unusual, with the large birds interlocking talons and spiraling down through the sky. The birds use sticks and twigs as building materials, and males and females cooperate in all matters of rearing the young. The huge nest is 1.45\u20132\u00a0m (4.8\u20136.6\u00a0ft) across and 1\u20133\u00a0m (3.3\u20139.8\u00a0ft) deep. The nest increases in size as a pair uses it repeatedly over the years and often comes to be decorated with dung and animal skins. The nests can range up to 1.5 to 12\u00a0m (4.9 to 39.4\u00a0ft) high in a large tree such as an oak, juniper, wild pear, almond or pine trees. Most nesting trees are found along cliffs. In a few cases, cinereous vultures have been recorded as nesting directly on cliffs. One cliff nest completely filled a ledge that was 3.63\u00a0m (11.9\u00a0ft) wide and 2.5\u00a0m (8.2\u00a0ft) in depth. The egg clutch typically only a single egg, though two may be exceptionally laid. The eggs have a white or pale buff base color are often overlaid with red, purplish or red-brown marks, being almost as spotted as the egg of a falcon. Eggs measure from 83.4 to 104\u00a0mm (3.28 to 4.09\u00a0in) in height and 58 to 75\u00a0mm (2.3 to 3.0\u00a0in) in width, with an average of 90\u00a0mm \u00d7\u00a069.7\u00a0mm (3.54\u00a0in \u00d7\u00a02.74\u00a0in). The incubation period can range from 50 to 62 days, averaging 50\u201356 days. Normally hatching occurs in April or May in Europe. The newly hatched young are semi-altricial. The young are covered in greyish-white to grey-brown colored down which becomes paler with age. The first flight feathers start growing from the same sockets as the down when the nestling is around 30 days old and completely cover the down by 60 days of age. The parents feed the young by regurgitation and an active nest reportedly becomes very foul and stinking. Weights of nestlings in Mongolia increased from as little as 2\u00a0kg (4.4\u00a0lb) when they are around a month old in early June to being slightly more massive than their parents at up to nearly 16\u00a0kg (35\u00a0lb) shortly before fledging in early autumn. Fledging is reported when the nestlings are 104\u2013120 days old, though dependence on parents can continue for another two months. Radio-satellite tracking suggests the age of independence of juveniles from their parents to be 5.7\u20137 months after hatching (i.e. 2\u20133 months after fledging).</p><p>The nesting success of cinereous vultures is relatively high, with around 90% of eggs successfully hatching and more than half of yearling birds known to survive to adulthood. They are devoted, active parents, with both members of a breeding pair protecting the nest and feeding the young in shifts via regurgitation. In Mongolia, Pallas's cat (<i>Otocolobus manul</i>) and the common raven (<i>Corvus corax</i>) are considered potential predators of eggs in potentially both tree and cliff nests. Gray wolves (<i>Canis lupus</i>) and foxes are also mentioned as potential nest predators, but since neither one can climb trees and there are also no incidents of predation on inaccessible cliff nests, this seems unlikely. There have been witnessed accounts of bearded vultures (<i>Gypaetus barbatus</i>) and Spanish imperial eagles (<i>Aquila adalberti</i>) attempting to kill nestlings, but in both cases they were chased off by the parents. There is a single case of a Spanish imperial eagle attacking and killing a cinereous vulture in an act of defense of its own nest in Spain. Golden eagles and Eurasian eagle-owls may rarely attempt to dispatch an older nestling or even adults in an ambush, but the species is not verified prey for either and it would be a rare event in all likelihood if it does occur. This species may live for up to 39 years, though 20 years or less is probably more common, with no regular predators of adults other than man.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Feeding\">Feeding</span></h3>\n\n<p>Like all vultures, the cinereous vulture eats mostly carrion. The cinereous vulture feeds on carrion of almost any type, from the largest mammals available to fish and reptiles. In Tibet, commonly eaten carcasses can include both wild and domestic yaks (<i>Bos mutus</i> and <i>Bos grunniens</i>), Bharal, Tibetan gazelles (<i>Pseudois nayaur</i>), kiangs (<i>Equus kiang</i>), woolly hares (<i>Lepus oiostolus</i>), Himalayan marmots (<i>Marmota himalayana</i>), domestic sheep (<i>Ovis aries</i>), and even humans, mainly those at their celestial burial grounds. Reportedly in Mongolia, Tarbagan marmots (<i>Marmota sibirica</i>) comprised the largest part of the diet, although that species is now endangered as it is preferred in the diet of local people, wild prey ranging from corsac fox (<i>Vulpes corsac</i>) to Argali (<i>Ovis ammon</i>) may be eaten additionally in Mongolia. Historically, cinereous vultures in the Iberian Peninsula fed mostly on European rabbit (<i>Oryctolagus cuniculus</i>) carcasses, but since viral hemorrhagic pneumonia (VHP) devastated the once abundant rabbit population there, the vultures now rely on the carrion of domestic sheep, supplemented by pigs (<i>Sus scrofa domesticus</i>) and deer. In Turkey, the dietary preferences were argali (<i>Ovis ammon</i>) (92 carrion items), wild boar (<i>Sus scrofa</i>) (53 items), chickens (<i>Gallus gallus domesticus</i>) (27 items), gray wolves (13 items) and red foxes (<i>Vulpes vulpes</i>) (13 items). Unusually, a large amount of plant material was found in pellets from Turkey, especially pine cones. Among the vultures in its range, the cinereous is best equipped to tear open tough carcass skins thanks to its powerful bill. It can even break apart bones, such as ribs, to access the flesh of large animals. It is dominant over other scavengers in its range, even over other large vultures such as <i>Gyps</i> vultures, bearded vultures or fierce ground predators such as foxes. While the noisy <i>Gyps</i> vultures squawk and fly around, the often silent cinereous vultures will keep them well at bay until they are satisfied and have had their own fill. A series of photos taken recently show a cinereous vulture attacking a Himalayan griffon in flight for unknown reasons, although the griffon was not seriously injured. Cinereous vultures frequently bully and dominate steppe eagles (<i>Aquila nipalensis</i>) when the two species are attracted to the same prey and carrion while wintering in Asia. A rare successful act of kleptoparasitism on a cinereous vulture was filmed in Korea when a Steller's sea eagle (<i>Haliaeetus pelagicus</i>) stole food from the vulture.</p>\n\n<p>Its closest living relative is probably the lappet-faced vulture, which takes live prey on occasion. Occasionally, the cinereous vulture has been recorded as preying on live prey as well. Live animals reportedly taken by cinereous vultures include calves of yaks and domestic cattle (<i>Bos primigenius taurus</i>), piglets, domestic lambs and puppies (<i>Canis lupus familiaris</i>), foxes, lambs of wild sheep, together with nestling and fledglings of large birds such as geese, swans and pheasants, various rodents and rarely amphibians and reptiles. This species has hunted tortoises (which the vultures are likely to kill by carrying in flight and dropping on rocks to penetrate the shell) and lizards. Although rarely observed in the act of killing ungulates, cinereous vultures have been recorded as flying low around herds and feeding on recently killed wild ungulates they are believed to have killed. Mainly neonatal lambs or calves are hunted, especially sickly ones. Although not normally thought to be a threat to healthy domestic lambs, rare predation on apparently healthy lambs has been confirmed. Species believed to be hunted by cinereous vultures have included argali, saiga antelope (<i>Saiga tatarica</i>), Mongolian gazelle (<i>Procapra gutturosa</i>) and Tibetan antelope (<i>Pantholops hodgsonii</i>).</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Status_and_conservation\">Status and conservation</span></h2>\n\n<p>The cinereous vulture has declined over most of its range in the last 200 years in part due to poisoning by eating poisoned bait put out to kill dogs and other predators, and to higher hygiene standards reducing the amount of available carrion; it is currently listed as Near Threatened. Vultures of all species, although not the target of poisoning operations, may be shot on sight by locals. Trapping and hunting of cinereous vultures is particularly prevalent in China and Russia, although the poaching for trophy hunting are also known for Armenia, and probably other countries in Caucasus. Perhaps an even greater threat to this desolation-loving species is development and habitat destruction. Nests, often fairly low in the main fork of a tree, are relatively easy to access and thus have been historically compromised by egg and firewood collectors regularly. The decline has been the greatest in the western half of the range, with extinction in many European countries (France, Italy, Austria, Poland, Slovakia, Albania, Moldova, Romania) and its entire breeding range in northwest Africa (Morocco and Algeria). They no longer nest in Israel. Turkey holds the second largest population of this species in the Western Palearctic. Despite the recent demographic bottleneck, this population has maintained moderate levels of genetic diversity, with no significant genetic structuring indicating that this is a single meta-population connected by frequent dispersal. More recently, protection and deliberate feeding schemes have allowed some local recoveries in numbers, particularly in Spain, where numbers increased to about 1,000 pairs by 1992 after an earlier decline to 200 pairs in 1970. This colony have now spread its breeding grounds to Portugal. Elsewhere in Europe, very small but increasing numbers breed in Bulgaria and Greece, and a re-introduction scheme is under way in France. Trends in the small populations in Ukraine (Crimea) and European Russia, and in Asian populations, are not well recorded. In the former USSR, it is still threatened by illegal capture for zoos, and in Tibet by rodenticides. It is a regular winter visitor around the coastal areas of Pakistan in small numbers. As of the turn of the 21st century, the worldwide population of cinereous vultures is estimated at 4,500\u20135,000 individuals.</p>\n\n<h2><span id=\"Culture_and_mythology\">Culture and mythology</span></h2>\n<p>The Hebrew word for \"eagle\" is also used for the cinereous vulture.

It is a widespread and common resident breeder throughout the temperate to subtropical Palearctic including North Africa. The black-crested tit is now usually included in this species.\n</p><p>There are a few different subspecies of the coal tit, those being the British, North African and continental ones. They are most commonly found throughout Europe and Russia in coniferous forests and trees.\n</p>\n\n\n<h2><span id=\"Taxonomy_and_systematics\">Taxonomy and systematics</span></h2>\n<p>This species was first described by Linnaeus in his 1758 edition of <i>Systema Naturae</i>. Linnaeus' primary reference was his earlier <i>Fauna Svecica</i>, whose cumbersome pre-binomial name <i>Parus capite nigro: vertice albo, dorso cinereo, pectore albo</i> (\"black-headed tit with white nape, ash-grey back, white breast\") became the much simpler yet no less unequivocal <i>Parus ater</i>. This name \u2013 meaning \"dusky-black tit\" \u2013 was simply adopted from older ornithological textbooks, ultimately going back to Conrad Gessner's 1555 <i>Historiae animalium</i>. He gave no type locality except \"Europe\", but his original description refers to the population inhabiting Sweden (which is consequently included in the nominate subspecies today). The current genus name, is Ancient Greek <i>peri</i> plus the pre-existing genus <i>Parus</i>. The specific <i>ater</i> is Latin for \"dull black\".</p>\n\n<p>Gessner also notes that the coal tit was known as <i>Kohlmei\u00df</i> in German \u2013 the literal equivalent of its English name, though in its modern orthography <i>Kohlmeise</i> it refers to the great tit (<i>Parus major</i>). That bird was in Gessner's day usually called <i>Spiegelmei\u00df</i> (\"multicolored tit\"), <i>Brandtmei\u00df</i> (\"burnt tit\") or <i>grosse Mei\u00df</i> (\"great tit\") in German. <i>K\u00f6lmey\u00df</i> was attested for <i>P. major</i> by William Turner, but Turner does not list <i>P. ater</i> at all, while Gessner notes that his hunters always used <i>Kohlmei\u00df</i> for the present species. However, this has since changed, and the modern German name of <i>P. ater</i> is <i>Tannenmeise</i> (\"fir tit\"), after a typical habitat. This name is attested (as <i>Tannen-Maise</i>) by Johann Leonhard Frisch in the early 18th century already, who furthermore records that <i>P. ater</i> was also called <i>Kleine Kohl-Maise</i> (\"small coal tit\") whereas <i>Kohl-Maise</i> referred unequivocally to <i>P. major</i>. Frisch collected his data in the Berlin region, where the German dialect was quite different from that spoken by Gessner's Alemannic sources 200 years earlier, and heavily influenced by Middle Low German  \u2013 the language of the northern German sources of Turner. Regarding that, <i>Tanne</i> is derived from the Old Saxon <i>danna</i>, and thus had spread through the German dialect continuum from north to south.\u00a0</p><p>Most authorities still treat the coal tit in the subgenus <i>Periparus</i>, but the American Ornithologists' Union considers <i>Periparus</i> a distinct genus. This is supported by mtDNA cytochrome <i>b</i> sequence analysis; <i>Periparus</i> seems to be closer to the <i>Poecile</i> tits and chickadees than to the great tit and its relatives. Thus, it belongs to the more advanced Paridae, in which the bright plumage of the more basal lineages is dulled down apomorphically.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, the same data suggest that this species is paraphyletic in regard to the closely related and parapatric spot-winged tit (<i>P. melanolophus</i>) from South Asia, which looks like a slightly crested, darker version of <i>P. ater</i>. Consequently, the spot-winged tit might have to be included in <i>P. ater</i>, or some coal tits could be considered a distinct species. As occasional hybridization has been recorded between the two, mtDNA alone (which is inherited only from the mother) is insufficient to determine whether hybrid gene flow or another trivial cause (such as incomplete lineage sorting) obfuscates the actual relationships, or whether taxonomic rearrangement is indeed required. With the range of these titmice encircling the Himalayas, without further study it cannot even be excluded that they constitute a ring species \u2013 with gene flow occurring in Nepal but not in Afghanistan \u2013 as has been shown for other passerines in the same region.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Subspecies\">Subspecies</span></h3>\n\n<p>A number of coal tit subspecies are distinguished. The differences in coloration are quite pronounced in some of them, while their differences in size are more subtle. Coal tits from Asia follow Bergmann's rule, being larger in colder regions; those from further west, however, do not, as the birds from the uplands around the Mediterranean are larger than those from northern Europe. Across its range, tail length in relation to body length increases along a cline running from southwest to northeast.</p><p>The British race <i>P. a. britannicus</i> has an olive hue to its brownish-grey back plumage, distinguishing it from the continental European nominate subspecies <i>P. a. ater</i> and <i>P. a. abietum</i> in which the back is bluish grey without a hint of green or brown. The Irish race <i>P. a. hibernicus</i> is distinguished from <i>britannicus</i> by the pale sulphur-yellow cheeks, breast and belly. It also has a paler rump (due to light fringes of the uppertail coverts) and a larger bill than its relatives from Britain and the Continent.</p><p>The North African race <i>P. a. ledouci</i> has yellow underparts and cheeks, and the Cypriot <i>P. a. cypriotes</i> has a buff tinge to its upperparts, and deep buff underparts. Asian subspecies are generally rather dusky brownish except for the black-and-white head; they include among others <i>P. a. michalowskii</i> of the Caucasus, <i>P. a. phaeonotus</i> of Iran, or the Himalayan coal tit <i>P. a. aemodius</i> of southwestern China.\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Description\">Description</span></h2>\n \n<p>The coal tit is 10\u201311.5\u00a0cm in length, and has a distinctive large white nape spot on its black head. The head, throat and neck of the adult are glossy blue-black, setting off the off-white sides of the face (tinged grey to yellow depending on subspecies) and the brilliant white nape; the white tips of the wing coverts appear as two wingbars. The underparts are whitish shading through buff to rufous on the flanks. The bill is black, the legs lead-coloured, and irides dark brown.\n</p><p>The young birds are duller than the adults, lacking gloss on the black head, and with the white of nape and cheeks tinged with yellow.\n</p><p>While searching for food, coal tit flocks keep contact with incessant short <i>dee</i> or <i>see-see</i> calls. The species' song \u2013 if \"song\" it can be called \u2013 is a strident <i>if-he, if-he, if-he</i>, heard most frequently from January to June, but also in autumn. The song resembles that of the great tit, but much faster and higher in pitch. One variant of this song ends with a sharp <i>ichi</i>. North African birds also have a <i>currr</i> call similar to that of the European crested tit (<i>Lophophanes cristatus</i>) which is not found in Africa.\n</p>\n\n<h2><span id=\"Behaviour_and_ecology\">Behaviour and ecology</span></h2>\n\n<p>It is typically a bird of temperate humid conifer forest, but apart from that shows little habitat specificity. In Bhutan for example coal tits are fairly common residents above the subtropical zone, at about 3,000\u20133,800 m ASL, and are found in forests dominated by Bhutan Fir (<i>Abies densa</i>) as well as in those characterized by Himalayan Hemlock (<i>Tsuga dumosa</i>) and rhododendrons.</p><p>The coal tit is an all-year resident throughout almost all range, making only local movements in response to particularly severe weather; only the Siberian birds have a more regular migration. Very rarely, vagrants may cross longer distances; for example the nominate subspecies of continental Europe was recorded in Ireland once in 1960 and once before that, but apparently not since then.\n</p><p>Coal tits will form small flocks in winter with other tits. This species resembles other tits in acrobatic skill and restless activity, though it more frequently pitches on a trunk, and in little hops resembles a treecreeper (<i>Certhia</i>). Its food is similar to that of the others; it is keen on beechmast, picks out the seeds from fir (<i>Abies</i>) and larch (<i>Larix</i>) cones, and joins <i>Carduelis</i> redpolls and siskins in alders (<i>Alnus</i>) and birches (<i>Betula</i>). It will also visit gardens to feed on a variety of foods put out, particularly sunflower seeds.\n</p><p>Coal tits in the laboratory prefer to forage at a variable feeding site when they are in a negative energy budget. They increase evening body mass in response to tawny owl calls. \nAfter dawn the coal tits increases body mass as soon as possible if food is obtained at a low rate, increasing body mass exponentially until an inflection point when the increase of body mass is slower. The inflection point of the body mass trajectory is 16.7% delayed compared to a high food availability. Subordinate coal tits are excluded from feeding sites by dominants more often in the early morning than in the rest of the day, and they showed more variability in daily mass gain and body mass at dawn than dominant coal tits.</p><p>Being common and widespread, the coal tit is not considered a threatened species by the IUCN.</p><p>The coal tit has the dubious distinction of having the largest number of bird fleas (<i>Ceratophyllus gallinae</i>) reported from a single nest, 5,754 fleas.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Breeding\">Breeding</span></h2>\n<p>A favourite nesting site is a hole in a rotting tree-stump, often low down, and the nest is deep within the hole; holes in the ground, burrows of mice or rabbits, chinks between the stones in walls, old nests of <i>Pica</i> magpies or other large birds, and squirrel dreys are also occupied. The materials, moss, hair and grass, are closely felted together, and rabbit fur or feathers added for lining. Seven to eleven red-spotted white eggs are laid, usually in May; this species breeds usually once per year.\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"See_also\">See also</span></h2>\n<ul><li>Common treecreeper and Hodgson's treecreeper</li>\n<li>Greenish warbler</li></ul><h2><span id=\"Footnotes\">Footnotes</span></h2>\n\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n<ul><li>Bangs, Outram (1932): Birds of western China obtained by the Kelley-Roosevelts expedition. <i>Field Mus.

Its range encompasses the northern regions of the Indian Subcontinent, mainly the Himalayas, along with some adjoining regions.  It is found in Bhutan, India, Myanmar, Nepal and Thailand. Its natural habitat is mountainous deciduous or mixed forests.\n</p>\n\n\n<h2><span id=\"Description\">Description</span></h2>\n<p>The collared grosbeak may be the largest species in the diverse finch family, but several other species, including others in the genus <i>Mycerobas</i>, may rival it in size. The species can range in length from 22 to 24\u00a0cm (8.7 to 9.4\u00a0in). The body mass of two males was reportedly 69 and 72\u00a0g (2.4 and 2.5\u00a0oz), while a single female weighed 83\u00a0g (2.9\u00a0oz). Among standard measurements, the wing chord is 12.1 to 13.8\u00a0cm (4.8 to 5.4\u00a0in), the tail is 8.7 to 9.7\u00a0cm (3.4 to 3.8\u00a0in), the bill is 2.7 to 2.9\u00a0cm (1.1 to 1.1\u00a0in) and the tarsus is 2.6 to 2.9\u00a0cm (1.0 to 1.1\u00a0in). Adult males are glossy black on the head, upper-wings and tail. Contrasting with the black head, the collar is an earthy brownish color. The rest of the male's plumage is a rich, deep yellow. The female is olive-green on back and yellowish below with no black about the face. The juvenile birds are fairly similar in appearance to the adult female.\n</p>\n \n<p>The flight call of this bird is a mellow but rapid <i>Pip-pip-pip-pip-uh</i>. It is also known to utter a sharp alarm call, <i>kurr</i>. The male's song is a clear, loud and rising whistle consisting of five to six notes. The grosbeaks may utter a creaky groan in antagonistic interactions.\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Phylogeny\">Phylogeny</span></h2>\n<p>The sister genera <i>Eophona</i> and <i>Mycerobas</i> form a clade.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Ecology\">Ecology</span></h2>\n<p>The collared grosbeak ranges from fairly common to scarce within its range. The species summers and breeds at an elevation of 2,700 to 4,200\u00a0m (8,900 to 13,800\u00a0ft). It engages in altitudinal movements, by winter traveling to as low as 1,800\u00a0m (5,900\u00a0ft) or even to 1,060\u00a0m (3,480\u00a0ft). This grosbeak occurs in mixed and coniferous forests, commonly around stands of maple, oak or rhododendron. It also may occur during the summer in dwarf juniper above the tree line in the mountains. Pairs or small parties usually perch near the tops of tall trees but forage often in lower vegetation or even on the ground. The collared grosbeak flies in tight flocks in a fast, direct but sometimes undulating flying style. The breeding behavior of this species is unknown. The grosbeak feeds on a variety of seeds and pine cones as well as buds or shoots, nuts, fruits (including crab apples). A variety of this tough plant life is plucked with the strong bill. It may also feed on insects, mainly caterpillars, as well as snails.\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n<ul><li><i>Finches and Sparrows</i> by Peter Clement.

Its natural habitat is submontane and montane forests with open spaces and is distributed throughout oriental Asia. It is the smallest owl in Asia, at 15\u00a0cm (5.9\u00a0in) and 60\u00a0g (2.1\u00a0oz).</p>\n\n\n<h2><span id=\"Taxonomy\">Taxonomy</span></h2>\n<p>The collared owlet was first described in 1836 as <i>Noctua brodiei</i> by the English zoologist Edward Burton.  It was moved to the genus <i>Glaucidium</i> based on a comparison of mitochondrial DNA sequences and proved to be closely related to the jungle owlet (<i>Glaucidium radiatum)</i> and the Asian barred owlet (<i>Glaucidium cuculoides).</i></p><p>Two subspecies are recognised:</p>\n<ul><li><i>G. b. brodiei</i> (Burton, 1836) \u2013 Himalayas to south China south through Indochina and the Malay Peninsula</li>\n<li><i>G. b. pardalotum</i> (Swinhoe, 1863) \u2013 Taiwan</li></ul><p>The Sunda owlet (<i>Glaucidium sylvaticum</i>) was formerly treated as a subspecies of the collared owlet. It was promoted to species status based on the results of a vocalisation study published in 2019.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Description\">Description</span></h2>\n<p>The collared owlet, being Asia's smallest owl species, measures between 15 and 17\u00a0cm. Females are generally larger than the males, weighing approximately 63 grams, whereas males weigh in at 52 grams.</p><p>This bird has a grey-brown colour (depending on age-morph) and has a barred back and flanks, while the head is more spotted than barred. They have prominent white eyebrows, vibrant lemon-yellow-coloured eyes and a white throat patch. The chin, center of the breast and belly are mostly white. The pale collar and the two black spots on each side of the nape imitate eye spots and make it seem like the owl is staring at you from behind. This is known as the \"occipital face\". It has a greyish-brown pale-spotted pectoral band on upper breast and lacks ear-tufts. You can see its tail when in flight, longer than most pygmy owls, and has rapid wingbeats.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Colour_morphs\">Colour morphs</span></h3>\n<p>Collared owlets transition through various age-dependent colour morphs. A capture-recapture study of collared owlets in Taiwan provided evidence of this. On the first capture, the individual was 56 days old and showed fledgling colour morph stage; having less spots and barring on the back and top of the head and not having a completely formed occipital. On the second recapture, the individual was captured 165 days after hatching and demonstrated a rufous morph; having an overall orange-red colour, barred back, spots on the head and a formed occipital. On the third recapture, the individual was 394 days old and was in its final grey morph.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Vocalizations\">Vocalizations</span></h3>\n<p>The collared owlet has very unusual but distinctive vocalizations. The male produces a 4-note phrase <i>\"w\u00fcp-w\u00fcw\u00fc-w\u00fcp\"</i> repeated at intervals of a few seconds, sometimes having incomplete phrases ending in \"<i>w\u00fcw\u00fc\"</i>. Their call starts mellow and becomes shriller with excitement while turning their head in all directions, creating a ventriloquial effect and making it hard to locate the bird.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Distribution_and_habitat\">Distribution and habitat</span></h2>\n<p>The collared owlet is a resident bird in its range.\n</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Distribution\">Distribution</span></h3>\n<p>The collared owlet has a very large range occurring in the Himalayas of northern Pakistan all the way to eastern China and Taiwan. Its range extends southwards through Malaysia. This bird can be found in the following countries: Bhutan, Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, China, India, Lao People's Democratic Republic, Malaysia, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, Taiwan, Thailand and Viet Nam.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Habitat\">Habitat</span></h3>\n<p>Their preferred habitat varies from evergreen forests, forest edges, mixed deciduous-evergreen forests with oak, rhododendron and fir and open woodlands with scrub. They can be found in submontane and montane habitats varying between 1350\u20132750 meters in altitude, but they have also been seen near cultivated lands as low as 700 meters in altitude.</p><p>Species in the genus <i>Glaucidium</i> are secondary cavity-nesters. For example, the Asian barred owlet was found to use the nest cavity of a collared scops owl once it was no longer using the nest. As for its other close relative, a study showed that the jungle owlet was found active in a secondary cavity nest in riparian forests. Just like the collared owlet's relatives, this small owl does not create its own nest, but rather nests in natural tree hollows or chambers created by woodpeckers and barbets.</p>\n\n<h2><span id=\"Behaviour_and_ecology\">Behaviour and ecology</span></h2>\n<p>Compared to other owls in the genus <i>Glaucidium</i>, the collared owlet is most active during daylight. Being diurnal, this bird can be seen perching, hunting and calling during most parts of the day, and sometimes during the night. It is often mobbed by other small birds when roosting.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Breeding\">Breeding</span></h3>\n<p>Although not much is known about the reproductive methods of the collared owlet, it is believed that the mating couple only remains together during the period of breeding season, which is from March to April.</p><p>As mentioned previously, they nest in natural tree hollows or holes created by woodpeckers or barbets, which are often very rotten and found high in tree trunks that are in a clearing or in an open area in the forest. The eggs are laid between late April and mid-June and their young are fledged from mid-June to early August. Clutch size varies between 3 and 5 hatchlings, and their eggs are round and white.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Food_and_feeding\">Food and feeding</span></h3>\n<p>Few studies has precisely identified the exact diet of the collared owlet, but we can presume that it is similar to the diet of its closest relative, the jungle owlet. The jungle owlet is seen to prey on small mammals such as house mice, little Indian field mice, brown spiny mice and white-toothed pygmy shrews; reptiles such as skinks; birds; amphibians and many invertebrates. Therefore, the diet of the collared owlet consists mainly on small birds, insect, lizards, invertebrates and small mammals. Although its small size, this raptor is extremely fierce and has been seen to capture prey as large as itself. Once their prey is captured, it is brought to a perch by its talons and torn up with upward pulls of the bill.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Status\">Status</span></h2>\n<p>Although the collared owlet is at least concern on the IUCN Red list, its main threat is habitat loss. In a study examining the effects of fragmentation on nocturnal birds in Asia, collared owlets were never found in forest fragments smaller than 100 hectares. The authors concluded that anthropogenic pressures such as deforestation can affect even small species such as the collared owlet.\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n\n<h2><span id=\"External_links\">External links</span></h2>\n<ul><li>eBird Collared Owlet Range Map</li>\n<li>Xeno-canto Collared Owlet Range Map and Sounds</li>\n<li>Collared Owlet Video</li>\n<li>Colour Morphs of Collared Owlets - Figure 3.

It has a wide range in summer, embracing practically the whole of Europe and the Mediterraneancountries and across the Palearctic to the Pacific Ocean. It is a Holarctic species also found in North America. It winters in eastern and southern Africa, South America, and the Indian Subcontinent.\n</p>\n\n\n<h2><span id=\"Taxonomy\">Taxonomy</span></h2>\n<p>This species was first described by Linnaeus in his <i>Systema Naturae</i> in 1758, and originally named <i>Hirundo riparia</i>; the description consisted of the simple <i>H[irundo] cinerea, gula abdomineque albis</i> \u2013 \"an ash-grey swallow, with white throat and belly\" \u2013 and the type locality was simply given as \"Europa\".  The specific name means \"of the riverbank\"; it is derived from the Latin <i>ripa</i> \"riverbank\".</p><p>The pale martin of northern India and southeastern China is now usually split as a separate species <i><b>Riparia diluta</b></i>. It has paler grey-brown upperparts and a less distinct breast band. It winters in Pakistan and southern India.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Description\">Description</span></h2>\n\n\n<p>The 12\u00a0cm (4.7\u00a0in) long sand martin is brown above, white below with a narrow brown band on the breast; the bill is black, the legs brown. The young have rufous tips to the coverts and margins to the secondaries.\n</p><p>Its brown back, white throat, small size and quick jerky flight separate it at once from similar swallows, such as the common house martin (<i>Delichon urbicum</i>), the American cliff swallow (<i>Petrochelidon pyrrhonota</i>) or other species of <i>Riparia</i>. Only the banded martin (<i>R. cincta</i>) of sub-Saharan Africa is similar, but the sand martin only occurs there in (the northern) winter.\n</p><p>The sand martin's twittering song is continuous when the birds are on the wing and becomes a conversational undertone after they have settled in the roost. The harsh alarm is heard when a passing falcon, crow or other suspected predator requires combined action to drive it away.\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Ecology\">Ecology</span></h2>\n\n<p>Linnaeus already remarked on this species' breeding habits: <i>Habitat in Europae collibus arenosis abruptis, foramine serpentino</i>\u2014\"it lives in Europe, in winding holes in sheer sandy hills\". It has been observed that sand martins favour loess as a particular type of ground to nest in. Sand martins are generally found near larger bodies of water, such as rivers, lakes or even the ocean, throughout the year.</p><p>The sand martin appears on its breeding grounds as the first of its family, starting towards the end of March, just in advance of the barn swallow. In northern Ohio, they arrive in numbers by mid-April, about 10 days earlier than they did 100 years ago. At first, they flit over the larger bodies of water alone, in search of early flies. Later parties accompany other swallow species, but for a time, varying according to weather, the birds remain at these large waters and do not visit their nesting haunts. The sand martin departs early, at any rate from its more northerly haunts. In August, the gatherings at the nightly roost increase enormously, though the advent and departure of passage birds causes great irregularity in numbers. They are essentially gone from their breeding range by the end of September.\n</p>\n\n\n<p>The food consists of small insects, mostly gnats and other flies whose early stages are aquatic.\n</p><p>The sand martin is sociable in its nesting habits; from a dozen to many hundred pairs will nest close together, according to available space. The nests are at the end of tunnels of from a few inches to three or four feet in length, bored in sand or gravel. The actual nest is a litter of straw and feathers in a chamber at the end of the burrow; it soon becomes a hotbed of parasites. Four or five white eggs are laid about mid-late May, and a second brood is usual in all but the most northernly breeding sites.\n</p><p>This is not a rare bird, and it is classified as a species of Least Concern by the IUCN. It does have some local protections, as certain populations have declined or face threats from habitat loss and fragmentation. They are considered threatened in California, where populations exist in the Sacramento Valley and at two coastal sites, A\u00f1o Nuevo State Park and Fort Funston.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n\n<h2><span id=\"Further_reading\">Further reading</span></h2>\n<ul><li><cite id=\"CITEREFHeneberg2003\" class=\"citation journal\">Heneberg, P.

They are vociferous, moving on the ground often with members keeping watch from the tops of bushes. They forage through the undergrowth hopping on the ground and creeping like rodents. When moving on the ground, they often keep the long tail raised. The calls include a rapid trill <i>which-which-whichi-ri-ri-ri-ri</i> while the alarm consists of a high pitched squeak. They are found mainly in dry regions with sparse and low thorny scrub vegetation. They feed on insects, berries and grains. Favourite berries include those of the <i>Lantana</i> and <i>Capparis</i>.</p><p>Several breeding pairs may be found within a group. Adults will often indulge in preening the head and neck feathers of other group members. The nesting season in India is in summer (May to July) with two peaks broken by a gap during the rains. They build a shallow cup nest low in a thorny bush and lay about 2-3 turquoise blue eggs. In northern India, they have been found to use heaps of lopped up <i>Zizyphus</i> for nesting. The eggs hatch after about 13\u201315 days. Broods may be parasitized by the Jacobin cuckoo and the common hawk-cuckoo. The young birds are able to fly about after about a week and continue to stay with the group, joining the adults at the roost. Helpers, possibly young birds from the previous brood may assist the parents, feeding the brooding females and the young birds. The feeding bird often hops after delivering food calls with a low trill and shivers its feathers. The gape of young birds is yellow and the iris colour changes from hazel to dark brown. They roost communally. The cooperative breeding structure is thought to be formed by groups of males with a shared lineage with the females moving out of their natal groups.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n\n<h2><span id=\"External_links\">External links</span></h2>\n<ul><li>Photographs and videos</li></ul>"

They also differ from the Strigidae in structural details relating in particular to the sternum and feet.</p><p>The barn-owls are a wide-ranging family, although they are absent from northern North America, Saharan Africa, and large areas of Asia. They live in a wide range of habitats from deserts to forests, and from temperate latitudes to the tropics. The majority of the twenty living species of barn-owls are poorly known. Some, like the red owl, have barely been seen or studied since their discovery, in contrast to the common barn-owl, which is one of the best known owl species in the world. However, some subspecies of the common barn-owl possibly deserve to be separate species, but are very poorly known.\n</p><p>Five species of barn-owl are threatened, and some island species have gone extinct during the Holocene or earlier (e.g. <i>Tyto pollens</i>, known from the fossil record of Andros Island in the Bahamas, and possibly the basis for the mythical Chickcharnie). The barn owls are mostly nocturnal, and generally non-migratory, living in pairs or singly.\n</p>\n\n\n<h2><span id=\"Taxonomy_and_systematics\">Taxonomy and systematics</span></h2>\n<p>The barn owls consist of two extant subfamilies: the Tytoninae or <i>Tyto</i> owls (including the common barn owl) and the Phodilinae or bay-owls. The Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy unites the Caprimulgiformes with the owl order; here, the barn-owls are a subfamily, Tytoninae. This is unsupported by more recent research (see Cypselomorphae), but the relationships of the owls in general are still unresolved.\n</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Extant_genera\">Extant genera</span></h3>\n<p>Two extant genera are recognized:</p>\n<ul><li>Genus <i>Tyto</i> \u2013 true barn-owls, grass owls and masked owls (17 species)</li>\n<li>Genus <i>Phodilus</i> \u2013 bay owls (3 species)</li></ul><h3><span id=\"Extinct_genera\">Extinct genera</span></h3>\n<p>The fossil record of the barn-owls goes back to the Eocene, with the family eventually losing ground to the true owls after the radiation of rodents and owls during the Neogene epoch.

This species is resident from southern Spain and Africa through India and tropical Asia to Indonesia.\n</p><p>This tiny buttonquail is notoriously difficult to see. It is a small, 15\u00a0cm (5.9\u00a0in) long drab running bird, which avoids flying. It inhabits warm grasslands or scrub jungle and feeds on insects and seeds. This species avoids thick forest and hilly country, and lives by preference in cornfields and stretches of grassy plain though it may also be found in any type of low herbage and open scrub jungle. It skulks and is flushed with difficulty, rising often close by one's feet. When flushed it flies low over the ground and soon settles again, after which it is very difficult to put up a second time.\n</p>\n\n<p>The common buttonquail resembles the common quail.

The male is brightly coloured with a blue-grey cap and rust-red underparts. The female is much duller in colouring, but both sexes have two contrasting white wing bars and white sides to the tail. The male bird has a strong voice and sings from exposed perches to attract a mate.\n</p><p>The chaffinch breeds in much of Europe, across the Palearctic to Siberia and in northwestern Africa. The female builds a nest with a deep cup in the fork of a tree. The clutch is typically four or five  eggs, which hatch in about 13\u00a0days. The chicks fledge in around 14\u00a0days, but are fed by both adults for several weeks after leaving the nest. Outside the breeding season, chaffinches form flocks in open countryside and forage for seeds on the ground. During the breeding season, they forage on trees for invertebrates, especially caterpillars, and feed these to their young. They are partial migrants; birds breeding in warmer regions are sedentary, while those breeding in the colder northern areas of their range winter further south.\n</p><p>The eggs and nestlings of the chaffinch are taken by a variety of mammalian and avian predators. Its large numbers and huge range mean that chaffinches are classed as of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.\n</p>\n\n\n<h2><span id=\"Taxonomy\">Taxonomy</span></h2>\n<p>The common chaffinch was described by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the 10th edition of his <i>Systema Naturae</i> under its current binomial name. <i>Fringilla</i> is the Latin word for finch, while <i>caelebs</i> means unmarried or single. Linnaeus remarked that during the Swedish winter, only the female birds migrated south through Belgium to Italy.</p><p>The English name comes from the Old English <i>ceaffinc</i>, where <i>ceaf</i> is \"chaff\" and <i>finc</i> \"finch\". Chaffinches were likely given this name because after farmers thresh their crops, these birds sometimes spend weeks picking through heaps of discarded chaff for grain. The chaffinch is one of the many birds depicted in the marginal decoration of the 15th century English illuminated manuscript the Sherborne Missal. The English naturalist William Turner described the common chaffinch in his book on birds published in 1544. Although the text is in Latin, Turner gives the English name as chaffinche and lists two folk names: sheld-appel and spink. The word <i>sheld</i> is a dialectal word meaning pied or multicoloured (as in shelduck). Appel may be related to <i>Alp</i>, an obsolete word for a bullfinch. The name <i>spink</i> is probably derived from the bird's call note. The names spink and shell apple are among the many folk names listed for the common chaffinch by Reverend Charles Swainson in his <i>Provincial Names and Folk Lore of British Birds</i> (1885).</p><p>The Fringillidae are all seed-eaters with stout conical bills. They have similar skull morphologies, nine large primaries, 12 tail feathers and no crop. In all species, the female builds the nest, incubates the eggs, and broods the young. Finches are divided into two subfamilies, the Carduelinae, containing around 28 genera with 141 species and the Fringillinae containing a single genus, <i>Fringilla</i>, with four species: the common chaffinch (<i>F. coelebs</i>), the Gran Canaria blue chaffinch (<i>F. polatzeki</i>), the Tenerife blue chaffinch (<i>F. teydea</i>), and the brambling (<i>F. montifringilla</i>). Fringilline finches raise their young almost entirely on arthropods, while the cardueline finches raise their young on regurgitated seeds.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Subspecies\">Subspecies</span></h3>\n<p>A number of subspecies of the common chaffinch have been described, based principally on the differences in the pattern and colour of the adult male plumage. The subspecies can be divided into three groups: the \"<i>coelebs</i> group\" that occurs in Europe and Asia, the \"<i>spondiogenys</i> group\" in North Africa, and the \"<i>canariensis</i> group\" on the Canary Islands. The subspecies from Madeira and the Azores are placed either in the \"<i>canariensis</i> group\" or in the \"<i>spondiogenys</i> group\". Genetic studies indicate that members of the \"<i>coelebs</i> group\" and the \"<i>spondiogenys</i> group\" are more closely related to each other than they are to members of the \"<i>canariensis</i> group\".</p><p>Within the \"<i>spondiogenys</i> group\", the gradual clinal variation over the large geographic range and the extensive intergradation means that the geographical limits and acceptance of the various subspecies varies between authorities. The International Ornithologists' Union lists 11 subspecies from this group, whereas Peter Clement in the Birds of the World lists seven and considers the features of the subspecies <i>balearica</i> (Mallorca), <i>caucasica</i> (the southern Caucasus), <i>schiebeli</i> (southern Greece, Crete and western Turkey), and <i>tyrrhenica</i> (Corsica) to fall within the variation of the nominate subspecies. He also suggests that the subspecies <i>alexandrovi</i>, <i>sarda</i>, <i>solomkoi</i>, and  <i>syriaca</i> may represent variations of the nominate subspecies.</p><p>The authors of a 2009 molecular phylogenetic study on the three subspecies that were recognised on the Canary Islands concluded that they are sufficiently distinct in both genotype and phenotype to be considered as separate species within the genus <i>Fringilla</i>. They also proposed a revised distribution of the subspecies on the islands in which the birds on La Palma (<i>palmae</i>) and El Hierro (<i>ombrioso</i>) are grouped together as a single subspecies, while the current <i>canariensis</i> subspecies is split into two, with one subspecies occurring only on Gran Canaria and the other on La Gomera and Tenerife. The results of a study published in 2018 confirmed the earlier findings. The authors formerly described the Gran Canaria variety as a subspecies and coined the trinomial name <i>Fringilla coelebs bakeri</i>.</p>\n<dl><dt><i>coelebs</i> group</dt></dl><ul><li><b>Northern Iranian chaffinch</b> (<i>F. c. alexandrovi</i>) Zarudny, 1916 \u2013 northern Iran</li>\n<li><b>Caucasian chaffinch</b> (<i>F. c. caucasica</i>) Serebrovski, 1925 \u2013 the Balkans and northern Greece to northern Turkey, central and eastern Caucasus and northwestern Iran</li>\n<li><b>European chaffinch</b> (<i>F. c. coelebs</i>) Linnaeus, 1758 (nominate subspecies) \u2013 Eurasia, from western Europe and Asia Minor to Siberia</li>\n<li><b>Iberian chaffinch</b> (<i>F. c. balearica</i>) von Jordans, 1923 \u2013 the Iberian Peninsula and the Balearic Islands</li>\n<li><b>British chaffinch</b> (<i>F. c. gengleri</i>) O.

The adult male of the nominate subspecies has a black forehead and a blue-grey crown, nape and upper mantle. The rump is a light olive-green; the lower mantle and scapulars form a brown saddle. The side of head, throat and breast are a dull rust-red merging to a pale creamy-pink on the belly. The central pair of tail feathers are dark grey with a black shaft streak.  The rest of the tail is black apart from the two outer feathers on each side which have white wedges. Each wing has a contrasting white panel on the coverts and a buff-white bar on the secondaries and inner primaries. The flight feathers are black with white on the basal portions of the vanes. The secondaries and inner primaries have pale yellow fringes on the outer web whereas the outer primaries have a white outer edge.</p><p>After the autumn moult, the tips of the new feathers have a buff fringe that adds a brown cast to the coloured plumage. The ends of the feathers wear away over the winter so that by the spring breeding season the underlying brighter colours are displayed. The eyes have dark brown irises and the legs are grey-brown. In winter the bill is a pale grey and slightly darker along the upper ridge or culmen, but in spring the bill becomes bluish-grey with a small black tip.</p>\n\n<p>The male of the subspecies resident in the British Isles (<i>F. c. gengleri</i>) closely resembles the nominate subspecies, but has a slightly darker mantle and underparts. The males of the two North African subspecies <i>F. c. africana</i> and <i>F. c. spodiogenys</i> have a blue-grey crown and nape that extends down to the sides of the head and neck, a black forehead and lore, a broken white eye-ring, a bright olive-green saddle and a pink-buff throat and breast. The males of <i>F. c. canariensis</i> and <i>F. c. palmae</i> in the Canary Islands have deep slate-blue upperparts and lack a contrasting mantle. Male chaffinches in Madeira (<i>F. c. maderensis</i>) and the Azores (<i>F. c. moreletti</i>) are similar in appearance to <i>F. c. canariensis</i>, but have a bright green mantle.</p><p>The adult female is much duller in appearance than the male. The head and most of the upperparts are shades of grey-brown. The underparts are paler. The lower back and rump are a dull olive green. The wings and tail are similar to those of the male. The juvenile resembles the female.</p>\n\n<h3><span id=\"Voice\">Voice</span></h3>\n<p>Males typically sing two or three different song types, and there are regional dialects also.</p><p>The acquisition by the young common chaffinch of its song was the subject of an influential study by British ethologist William Thorpe. Thorpe determined that if the young common chaffinch is not exposed to the adult male's song during a certain critical period after hatching, it will never properly learn the song. He also found that in adult common chaffinches, castration eliminates the song, but injection of testosterone induces such birds to sing even in November, when they are normally silent.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Distribution_and_habitat\">Distribution and habitat</span></h2>\n<p>The common chaffinch breeds in wooded areas where the July isotherm is between 12 and 30\u00a0\u00b0C (54 and 86\u00a0\u00b0F). The breeding range includes northwestern Africa and most of Europe and extends eastwards across temperate Asia to the Angara River and the southern end of Lake Baikal in Siberia. There are also a number of distinctive subspecies on the Azores, the Canary Islands and the Madeira Islands in the Atlantic Ocean. The common chaffinch was introduced from Great Britain into several of its overseas territories in the second half of the 19th century. In New Zealand, the common chaffinch had colonised both the North and South Islands by 1900 and is now one of the most widespread and common passerine species. In South Africa, a very small breeding colony in the suburbs of Constantia, Hout Bay and Camps Bay in Cape Town is the only remnant of another such introduction.</p><p>This bird is not migratory in the milder parts of its range, but vacates the colder regions in winter. It forms loose flocks outside the breeding season, sometimes mixed with bramblings. It occasionally strays to eastern North America, although some sightings may be escapees.\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Behaviour\">Behaviour</span></h2>\n\n<h3><span id=\"Breeding\">Breeding</span></h3>\n<p>Common chaffinches first breed when they are 1 year old. They are mainly monogamous and the pair-bond for residential subspecies such as <i>gengleri</i> sometimes persists from one year to the next. The date for breeding is dependent on the spring temperature and is earlier in southwest Europe and later in the northeast. In Great Britain, most clutches are laid between late April and the middle of June. A male attracts a female to his territory through song.</p><p>Nests are built entirely by the female and are usually located in the fork of a bush or a tree several metres above the ground. The nest has a deep cup and is lined with a layer of thin roots and feathers. The outside is covered with a layer of lichen and spider silk over an inner layer of moss and grass. The eggs are laid in early morning at daily intervals until the clutch is complete. The clutch is typically 4\u20135 eggs, which are smooth and slightly glossy, but very variable in colour. They range from pale-blueish green to light red with purple-brown blotches, spots or steaks. The average size of an egg is 19\u00a0mm \u00d7\u00a015\u00a0mm (0.75\u00a0in \u00d7\u00a00.59\u00a0in) with a weight of 2.2\u00a0g (0.078\u00a0oz). The eggs are incubated for 10\u201316 days by the female. The chicks are altricial, hatching nearly naked with closed eyes, and are fed by both parents but mainly by the female, who broods them for around six days. They are mainly fed caterpillars. The nestlings fledge 11\u201318 days after hatching and disperse. The young birds are then assisted with feeding by both parents for a further three weeks. The parents only very rarely start a second brood, but when they do so it is always in a new nest. Juveniles undergo a partial moult at around five weeks of age in which they replace their head, body and many of their covert feathers, but not their primary and secondary flight feathers. After breeding adult birds undergo a complete annual moult which lasts around ten weeks.</p><p>In a study carried out in Britain using ring-recovery data, the survival rate for juveniles in their first year was 53\u00a0per cent, and the adult annual survival rate was 59\u00a0per cent. From these figures the typical lifespan is only 3 years,but the maximum age recorded is 15 years and 6 months for a bird in Switzerland.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Feeding\">Feeding</span></h3>\n<p>Outside the breeding season, common chaffinches mainly eat seeds and other plant material that they find on the ground.  They often forage in open country in large flocks. Common chaffinches seldom take food directly from plants and only very rarely use their feet for handling food. During the breeding season, their diet switches to invertebrates, especially defoliating caterpillars. They forage in trees and also occasionally make short sallies to catch insects in the air. The young are entirely fed with invertebrates which include caterpillars, aphids, earwigs, spiders and grubs (the larvae of beetles).</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Predators_and_parasites\">Predators and parasites</span></h2>\n<p>The eggs and nestlings of the common chaffinch are predated by crows, Eurasian red and eastern grey squirrels, domestic cats and probably also by stoats and weasels. Clutches begun later in the spring suffer less predation, an effect that is believed to be due to the increased vegetation making nests more difficult to find. Unlike the case for the closely related brambling, the common chaffinch is not parasitised by the common cuckoo.</p><p>The protozoal parasite <i>Trichomonas gallinae</i> was known to infect pigeons and raptors, but beginning in Great Britain in 2005, carcasses of dead European greenfinches and common chaffinches were found to be infected with the parasite. The disease spread and in 2008, infected carcasses were found in Norway, Sweden and Finland and a year later in Germany. The spread of the disease is believed to have been mediated by common chaffinches, as large numbers of the birds breed in northern Europe and winter in Great Britain. In Great Britain, the number of infected carcasses recovered each year declined after a peak in 2006. There was a reduction in the number of European greenfinches but no significant decline in the overall number of common chaffinches. A similar pattern occurred in Finland where, after the arrival of the disease in 2008, there was a reduction in the number of European greenfinches, but only a small change in the number of common chaffinches.</p><p>Common chaffinches can develop tumors on their feet and legs caused by the <i>Fringilla coelebs</i> papillomavirus. The size of the papillomas range from a small nodule on a digit to a large growth involving both the foot and the leg. The disease is uncommon: in a 1973 study undertaken in the Netherlands, of around 25,000 common chaffinches screened, only 330 bore papillomas.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Status\">Status</span></h2>\n<p>The common chaffinch has an extensive range, estimated at 7 million square kilometres (3.7 million square miles) and a large population including an estimated 130\u2013240 million breeding pairs in Europe. Allowing for the birds breeding in Asia, the total population lies between 530\u20131,400 million individuals.  There is no evidence of any serious overall decline in numbers, so the species is classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as being of Least Concern.</p><p>The endemic subspecies on the Macaronesian islands in the Atlantic are vulnerable to the loss of habitat, especially <i>F. c. ombriosa</i> on El Hierro in the Canary Islands, where the breeding population is between 1,000-5,000 pairs.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Relationship_to_humans\">Relationship to humans</span></h2>\n<p>The common chaffinch was once popular as a caged songbird and large numbers of wild birds were trapped and sold. At the end of the 19th century, trapping even depleted the number of birds in London parks. In 1882, the English publisher Samuel Orchart Beeton issued a guide on the care of caged birds and included the recommendation: \"To parents and guardians plagued with a morose and sulky boy, my advice is, buy him a chaffinch.\" Competitions were held where bets were placed on which caged common chaffinch would repeat its song the greatest number of times. The birds were sometimes blinded with a hot needle in the belief that this encouraged them to sing. This practice is the subject of the poem <i>The Blinded Bird</i> by the English author Thomas Hardy, which contrasts the cruelty involved in blinding the birds with their zestful song. In Great Britain, the practice of keeping common chaffinches as pets declined after the trapping of wild birds was outlawed by the Wild Birds Protection Acts of 1880 to 1896.</p><p>The common chaffinch is still a popular pet bird in some European countries. In Belgium, the traditional sport of vinkenzetting pits male common chaffinches against one another in a contest for the most bird calls in an hour.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Image_gallery\">Image gallery</span></h2>\n<ul class=\"gallery mw-gallery-traditional\"><li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\">\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\">\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\">\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\">\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\">\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\">\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\">\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\">\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\">\n</ul><h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n\n<h2><span id=\"Sources\">Sources</span></h2>\n\n<h2><span id=\"Further_reading\">Further reading</span></h2>\n<link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r886047268\">\n<h2><span id=\"External_links\">External links</span></h2>\n<ul><li><cite class=\"citation web\">\"Fringilla coelebs\". <i>Avibase</i>.</cite><span title=\"ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rft.genre=unknown&amp;rft.jtitle=Avibase&amp;rft.atitle=Fringilla+coelebs&amp;rft_id=https%3A%2F%2Favibase.bsc-eoc.org%2Fspecies.jsp%3Flang%3DEN%26avibaseid%3D37F522810CADE42A&amp;rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fen.wikipedia.org%3ACommon+chaffinch\"></span><link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r951705291\"> </li>\n<li>Internet Bird Collection</li>\n<li>Ageing and sexing (PDF; 3.6 MB) by Javier Blasco-Zumeta &amp; Gerd-Michael Heinze</li>\n<li>Feathers of Common Chaffinch (Fringilla coelebs)</li>\n<li>Vocalisations on Xeno-canto</li>\n<li>Sonagrams of Chaffinch songs (Fringilla coelebs)</li></ul>"

It is found in Europe, Asia, Australia, New Zealand and parts of North Africa. It has a slaty-black body, a glossy black head and a white bill with a white frontal shield. The sexes are similar.\n</p>\n\n\n<h2><span id=\"Taxonomy\">Taxonomy</span></h2>\n<p>The Eurasian coot was formally described by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his <i>Systema Naturae</i> under its current binomial name <i>Fulica atra</i>. Linnaeus specified the locality as Europe but this is now restricted to Sweden. The binomial name is from Latin: <i>Fulica</i> means \"coot\", and <i>atra</i> mean \"black\".</p><p>Four subspecies are recognised:</p>\n<ul><li><i>F. a. atra</i> Linnaeus, 1758 \u2013 Europe and north Africa to Japan, India, southeast Asia, Philippines and Borneo</li>\n<li><i>F. a. lugubris</i> M\u00fcller, S, 1847 \u2013 Java, Bali, northwest New Guinea</li>\n<li><i>F. a. novaeguineae</i> Rand, 1940 \u2013 central New Guinea</li>\n<li><i>F. a. australis</i> Gould, 1845 \u2013 Australia and New Zealand</li></ul><p>An extinct subspecies <i>F. atra pontica</i>,  has been described from the Chalcolithic (around 4800-4400 BP) from the Bulgarian Black Sea Coast.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Description\">Description</span></h2>\n<p>The Eurasian coot is 36\u201338\u00a0cm (14\u201315\u00a0in) in length with a wing-span of 70\u201380\u00a0cm (28\u201331\u00a0in); males weigh around 890\u00a0g (31\u00a0oz) and females 750\u00a0g (26\u00a0oz). It largely black except for the white bill and frontal shield (which gives rise to the phrase \"as bald as a coot\", in use as early as 1430). As a swimming species, the coot has partial webbing on its long strong toes. The sexes are similar in appearance.</p><p>The juvenile is paler than the adult, has a whitish breast, and lacks the facial shield; the adult black plumage develops when about 3\u20134 months old, but the white shield is only fully developed at about one year old.\n</p><p>This is a noisy bird with a wide repertoire of crackling, explosive, or trumpeting calls, often given at night.\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Distribution_and_habitat\">Distribution and habitat</span></h2>\n\n<p>The coot breeds across much of the Old World on freshwater lakes and ponds. It occurs and breeds in Europe, Asia, Australia, and Africa. The species has recently expanded its range into New Zealand. It is resident in the milder parts of its range, but migrates further south and west from much of Asia in winter as the waters freeze.\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Behaviour_and_ecology\">Behaviour and ecology</span></h2>\n<p>The Eurasian coot is much less secretive than most of the rail family, and can be seen swimming on open water or walking across waterside grasslands. It is an aggressive species, and strongly territorial during the breeding season, and both parents are involved in territorial defence. During the non-breeding season they may form large flocks, possibly related to predator avoidance.</p><p>It is reluctant to fly and when taking off runs across the water surface with much splashing. It does the same, but without actually flying, when travelling a short distance at speed in territorial disputes or on land to escape from intruders. As with many rails, its weak flight does not inspire confidence, but on migration, usually at night, it can cover surprisingly large distances. It bobs its head as it swims, and makes short dives from a little jump.\n</p><p>When fighting other waterbirds (especially other coots), the coot attacks by charging its opponent and striking them with its long legs.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Breeding\">Breeding</span></h3>\n\n<p>The nest is a bulky structure that is placed on the bottom in shallow water. It is constructed of plant stems and leaves with a lining of finer material. Normally concealed in vegetation the nest can sometimes be placed in the open. It is built by both sexes with the male collecting most of the material which is incorporated by the female. The eggs are laid at daily intervals. The clutch contains between six and ten smooth and slightly glossy buff coloured eggs that are covered with black or dark brown speckles. On average they are 53\u00a0mm \u00d7\u00a036\u00a0mm (2.1\u00a0in \u00d7\u00a01.4\u00a0in) and weigh 38\u00a0g (1.3\u00a0oz). The eggs are incubated by both sexes beginning after the second egg is laid and hatch asynchronously after 21 to 24 days. The chicks are precocial and nidifugous. The chicks are covered with a black down. On the body the down has yellow hair-like tips. On the sides of the head, nape and throat the hair-like tips are longer and orange-red. Between the eyes and on the lores, the tips are red. The shield is bright red and the bill is red with a white tip. The young are brooded by the female for the first three to four days during which time food is brought by the male. The male also builds one or more platforms that is used for roosting and brooding the chicks. On leaving the nest, the brood is sometimes split up with each parent taking care of a separate group. The young can feed themselves when they are around 30 days and fledge at 55 to 60 days. Eurasian coots normally only have a single brood each year but in some areas such as Britain they will sometimes attempt a second brood. They first breed when they are one to two years old.</p><p>Chick mortality occurs mainly due to starvation rather than predation.  Most chicks died in the first 10 days after hatching, when they are most dependent on adults for food. Coots can be very brutal to their own young under pressure such as the lack of food. They will bite young that are begging for food and repeatedly do this until it stops begging. If the begging continues, they may bite so hard that the chick is killed. Coots will also lay their eggs in the nests of other coots when their environment or physical condition limits their ability to breed, or to lengthen their reproductive life.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Feeding\">Feeding</span></h3>\n\n<p>The coot is an omnivore, and will take a variety of small live prey including the eggs of other water birds, as well as algae, vegetation, seeds and fruit. It shows considerable variation in its feeding techniques, grazing on land or in the water. In the water it may upend in the fashion of a mallard or dive in search of food.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Status\">Status</span></h2>\n<p>The Eurasian coot is one of the species to which the <i>Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds</i> (AEWA) applies.\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n\n<h2><span id=\"Sources\">Sources</span></h2>\n\n<h2><span id=\"External_links\">External links</span></h2>\n<ul><li>Eurasian coot photo gallery at VIREO (Drexel University)</li>\n<li>Ageing and sexing (PDF; 1.8 MB) by Javier Blasco-Zumeta &amp; Gerd-Michael Heinze</li>\n<li>Feathers of Eurasian Coot (Fulica atra)</li>\n<li>BirdLife species factsheet for <i>Fulica atra</i></li>\n<li><cite class=\"citation web\">\"Fulica atra\". <i>Avibase</i>.</cite><span title=\"ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rft.genre=unknown&amp;rft.jtitle=Avibase&amp;rft.atitle=Fulica+atra&amp;rft_id=https%3A%2F%2Favibase.bsc-eoc.org%2Fspecies.jsp%3Flang%3DEN%26avibaseid%3DB682B2A9C922D4C4&amp;rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fen.wikipedia.org%3AEurasian+coot\"></span><link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r951705291\"> </li>\n<li>Audio recordings of Eurasian coot on Xeno-canto.</li></ul>"

        "details": "<p class=\"mw-empty-elt\">\n</p>\n<p>The <b>common crane</b> (<i>Grus grus</i>), also known as the <b>Eurasian crane</b>, is a bird of the family Gruidae, the cranes. A medium-sized species, it is the only crane commonly found in Europe besides the demoiselle crane (<i>Anthropoides virgo</i>). Along with the sandhill (<i>Grus canadensis</i>) and demoiselle cranes and the brolga (<i>Grus rubicunda</i>), it is one of only four crane species not currently classified as threatened with extinction or conservation dependent on the species level. Despite the species' large numbers, local extinctions and extirpations have taken place in part of its range, and an ongoing reintroduction project is underway in the United Kingdom.</p>\n\n\n<h2><span id=\"Taxonomy\">Taxonomy</span></h2>\n<p>The first formal description of the common crane was by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his <i>Systema Naturae</i> under the binomial name <i>Ardea grus</i>. The current genus <i>Grus</i> was erected by the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson in 1760. <i>Grus</i> is the Latin word for a \"crane\".</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Description\">Description</span></h2>\n\n<p>The common crane is a large, stately bird and a medium-sized crane. It is 100\u2013130\u00a0cm (39\u201351\u00a0in) long with a 180\u2013240\u00a0cm (71\u201394\u00a0in) wingspan. The body weight can range from 3 to 6.1\u00a0kg (6.6 to 13.4\u00a0lb), with the nominate subspecies averaging around 5.4\u00a0kg (12\u00a0lb) and the eastern subspecies (<i>G. g. lilfordi</i>) averaging 4.6\u00a0kg (10\u00a0lb). Among standard measurements, the wing chord is 50.7\u201360.8\u00a0cm (20.0\u201323.9\u00a0in) long, the tarsus is 20.1\u201325.2\u00a0cm (7.9\u20139.9\u00a0in) and the exposed culmen is 9.5\u201311.6\u00a0cm (3.7\u20134.6\u00a0in).\n</p><p>Males are slightly heavier and larger than females, with weight showing the largest sexual size dimorphism, followed by wing, central toe, and head length in adults and juveniles. </p><p>This species is slate-grey overall. The forehead and lores are blackish with a bare red crown and a white streak extending from behind the eyes to the upper back. The overall colour is darkest on the back and rump and palest on the breast and wings. The primaries, the tips of secondaries, the alula, the tip of the tail, and the edges of upper tail coverts are all black and the greater coverts droop into explosive plumes. This combination of colouration ultimately distinguishes it from similar species in Asia, like the hooded (<i>G. monacha</i>) and black-necked cranes (<i>G. nigricollis</i>). The juvenile has yellowish-brown tips to its body feathers and lacks the drooping wing feathers and the bright neck pattern of the adult, and has a fully feathered crown. Every two years, before migration, the adult common crane undergoes a complete moult, remaining flightless for six weeks, until the new feathers grow.\n</p><p>It has a loud trumpeting call, given in flight and display. The call is piercing and can be heard from a considerable distance. It has a dancing display, leaping with wings uplifted, described in detail below.\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Distribution\">Distribution</span></h2>\n\n\n<p>This species is found in the northern parts of Europe and across the Palearctic to Siberia. Formerly the species was spread as far west as Ireland, but about 200 years ago, it became extinct there. However, it has since started to return to Ireland naturally and there are now plans to help it return to Ireland on a greater scale. The common crane is an uncommon breeder in southern Europe, smaller numbers breeding in Greece, former-Yugoslavia, Romania, Denmark and Germany. Larger breeding populations can be found in Scandinavia, especially Finland and Sweden. The heart of the breeding population for the species is in Russia, however, where possibly up to 100,000 cranes of this species can be found seasonally. It is distributed as a breeder from Ukraine to the Chukchi Peninsula in Russia. The breeding population extends as far south as Manchuria but almost the entire Asian breeding population is restricted to Russia. Approximately 48-50 breeding pairs exist in the UK, with population centres in Somerset and Norfolk.\n</p><p>The species is a long distance migrant predominantly wintering in northern Africa. Autumn migration is from August to October in the breeding areas, but from late October to early December at the wintering sites. Spring migration starts in February at wintering sites up to early March, but from March through May at the breeding areas. Migration phenology of common cranes is changing due to climate change.  Important staging areas occur anywhere from Sweden, The Netherlands and Germany to China (with a large one around the Caspian Sea) and many thousand cranes can be seen in one day in the Autumn. Some birds winter in southern Europe, including Portugal, Spain and France. Most eastern common cranes winter in the river valleys of Sudan, Ethiopia, Tunisia and Eritrea with smaller numbers in Turkey, northern Israel, Iraq and parts of Iran. The third major wintering region is in the northern half of Indian subcontinent, including Pakistan. Minimal wintering also occurs in Burma, Vietnam and Thailand. Lastly, they winter in eastern China, where they are often the most common crane (outnumbering black-necked cranes ten-to-one). Migrating flocks fly in a \"V\" formation.\n</p><p>It is a rare visitor to Japan and Korea, mostly blown over from the Chinese wintering population, and is a rare vagrant to western North America, where birds are occasionally seen with flocks of migrating sandhill cranes.\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Habitat\">Habitat</span></h2>\n\n<p>In Europe, the common crane predominantly breeds in boreal and taiga forest and mixed forests, from an elevation of sea-level to 2,200\u00a0m (7,200\u00a0ft). In northern climes, it breeds in treeless moors, on bogs, or on dwarf heather habitats, usually where small lakes or pools are also found. In Sweden, breeders are usually found in small, swampy openings amongst pine forests, while in Germany, marshy wetlands are used. Breeding habitat used in Russia are similar, though they can be found nesting in less likely habitat such as steppe and even semi-desert, so long as water is near. Primarily, the largest number of common cranes are found breeding in wooded swamps, bogs and wetlands and seem to require quiet, peaceful environs with minimal human interference. They occur at low density as breeders even where common, typically ranging from 1 to 5 pairs per 100\u00a0km<sup>2</sup> (39\u00a0sq\u00a0mi).\n</p><p>In winter, this species moves to flooded areas, shallow sheltered bays, and swampy meadows. During the flightless moulting period there is a need for shallow waters or high reed cover for concealment. Later, after the migration period, the birds winter regularly in open country, often on cultivated lands and sometimes also in savanna-like areas, for example on the Iberian Peninsula.\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Behaviour\">Behaviour</span></h2>\n<h3><span id=\"Diet\">Diet</span></h3>\n<p>The common crane is omnivorous, as are all cranes. It largely eats plant matter, including roots, rhizomes, tubers, stems, leaves, fruits and seeds. They also commonly eat, when available, pond-weeds, heath berries, peas, potatoes, olives, acorns, cedarnuts and pods of peanuts. Notably amongst the berries consumed, the cranberry, is possibly named after the species.</p><p>Animal foods become more important during the summer breeding season and may be the primary food source at that time of year, especially while regurgitating to young. Their animal foods are insects, especially dragonflies, and also snails, earthworms, crabs, spiders, millipedes, woodlice, amphibians, rodents, and small birds.\n</p><p>Common cranes may either forage on land or in shallow water, probing around with their bills for any edible organism. Although crops may locally be damaged by the species, they mostly consume waste grain in winter from previously harvested fields and so actually benefit farmers by cleaning fields for use in the following year. As with other cranes, all foraging (as well as drinking and roosting) is done in small groups, which may variously consist of pairs, family groups or winter flocks.\n</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Breeding\">Breeding</span></h3>\n\n\n<p>This species usually lays eggs in May, though seldom will do so earlier or later. Like most cranes, this species displays indefinite monogamous pair bonds. If one mate dies, a crane may attempt to court a new mate the following year. Although a pair may be together for several years, the courtship rituals of the species are enacted by every pair each spring. The dancing of common cranes has complex, social meanings and may occur at almost any time of year. Dancing may include bobs, bows, pirouettes, and stops, as in various crane species. Aggressive displays may include ruffled wing feathers, throwing vegetation in the air and pointing the bare red patch on their heads at each other. Courtship displays begin with a male following the female in a stately, march-like walk. The unison call, consists of the female holding her head up and gradually lowering down as she calls out. The female calls out a high note and then the male follows with a longer scream in a similar posture. Copulation consists of a similar, dramatic display.\n</p><p>The nesting territory of common cranes is variable and is based on the local habitat. It can range in size from variously 2 to 500\u00a0ha (4.9 to 1,235.5 acres). In common with sandhill cranes (and no other crane species), common cranes \"paint\" their bodies with mud or decaying vegetation, apparently in order to blend into their nesting environment. The nest is either in or very near shallow water, often with dense shore vegetation nearby, and may be used over several years. The size and placement of the nest varies considerably over the range, with Arctic birds building relatively small nests. In Sweden, an average nest is around 90\u00a0cm (35\u00a0in) across.\n</p><p>The clutch of the common crane usually contains two eggs, with seldom one laid and, even more rarely, 3 or 4. If a clutch is lost early in incubation, the cranes may be able to lay another one within a couple of weeks. The incubation period is around 30 days and is done primarily by the female but occasionally by both sexes. If humans approach the nest both parents may engage in a distraction display but known ground predators (including domestic dogs (<i>Canis lupus familiaris</i>)) are physically attacked almost immediately.\n</p><p>New hatchlings are generally quite helpless but are able to crawl away from danger within a few hours, can swim soon after hatching and can run with their parents at 24 hours old. Chicks respond to danger by freezing, using their camouflaged brownish down to defend them beyond their fierce parents. Young chicks use their wings to stabilise them while running, while by 9 weeks of age they can fly short distances. The adult birds go through their postbreeding moult while caring for their young, rendering them flightless for about 5 to 6 weeks around the time the young also can't fly yet. According to figures of cranes wintering in Spain, around 48% birds have surviving young by the time they winter and around 18% are leading two young by winter. By the next breeding season, the previous years young often flock together. The age of sexual maturity in wild birds has been estimated at variously from 3 to 6 years of age. It is thought that it is common for this species to live up to 30 or 40 years of age.</p>\n\n<h3><span id=\"Sociality\">Sociality</span></h3>\n<p>The common crane is a fairly social bird while not breeding. Flocks of up to 400 birds may be seen flying together during migration. Staging sites, where migrating birds gather to rest and feed in the middle of their migration, may witness thousands of cranes gathering at once. However, the flocks of the species are not stable social units but rather groups that ensure greater safety in numbers and collectively draw each other's attention to ideal foraging and roosting sites. Possibly due to a longer molt, younger and non-breeding cranes are usually the earliest fall migrants and may band together at that time of year. During these migratory flights, common cranes have been known to fly at altitudes of up to 33,000\u00a0ft (10,000\u00a0m), one of the highest of any species of bird, second only to the Ruppell's Griffin Vulture.</p><p>Cranes use a kleptoparasitic strategy to recover from temporary reductions in feeding rate, particularly when the rate is below the threshold of intake necessary for survival. Accumulated intake of common cranes during daytime at a site of stopover and wintering shows a typical anti-sigmoid shape, with greatest increases of intake after dawn and before dusk.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Interspecies_interactions\">Interspecies interactions</span></h3>\n<p>There are few natural predators of adult cranes, although white-tailed eagle (<i>Haliaeetus albicilla</i>), Bonelli's eagles (<i>Aquila fasciata</i>) and golden eagles (<i>Aquila chrysaetos</i>) are a potential predatory threat to common cranes of all ages. The crane has been known to counterattack eagles both on the land and in mid-flight, using their bill as a weapon and kicking with their feet. Common cranes were additionally recorded as prey for Eurasian eagle-owls (<i>Bubo bubo</i>) in the Ukok Plateau of Russia. Mammals such as wild boar (<i>Sus scrofa</i>), wolverine (<i>Gulo gulo</i>) and red foxes (<i>Vulpes vulpes</i>) are attacked at the nest, as they are potential predators. When facing off against mammals, cranes jab with their bill, hit with their wings and kick with their feet. The cranes nimbly avoid strikes against themselves by jumping into the air. It is probable that are threatened by a wider range of large mammalian predators as is the black-necked crane but these have not yet been recorded. Herbivorous mammals such as red deer (<i>Cervus elaphus</i>) may also be attacked at the nest, indicating the high aggressiveness of the birds while nesting. The determined attack of a parent crane often assures safety from predators, but occasional losses to predation are inevitable. The carrion crow (<i>Corvus corone</i>) is locally a successful predator of common cranes' eggs, trickily using distraction displays to steal them. Other species of <i>Corvus</i> may also cause some loss of eggs, with common ravens (<i>Corvus corax</i>) also taking some small chicks. Common cranes may loosely associate with any other crane in the genus <i>Grus</i> in migration or winter as well as greater white-fronted geese and bean geese.\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Status\">Status</span></h2>\n<p>The global population is 600,000 (2014 estimate) with the vast majority nesting in Russia and Scandinavia. In some areas the breeding population appears to be increasing, such as in Sweden, whereas on the fringes of its range, it is often becoming rare to non-existent. In Great Britain, the common crane became extirpated in the 17th century, but a tiny population now breeds again in the Norfolk Broads and is slowly increasing and a reintroduction has been underway since 2010 for the Somerset levels. In Ireland, it died out as a breeding species in the 18th century, but a flock of about 30 appeared in County Cork in November 2011, and a smaller flock a year later. It was additionally extirpated as a breeder from Austria around 1900, from Hungary by 1952 and from Spain by 1954. The recovering German breeding population of 8,000 pairs is still also a fraction of the size of the large numbers that once bred in the country. Poland has 15,000 breeding pairs, 50 pairs breed in the Czech Republic and 2009 was the first confirmed breeding in Slovakia.\n</p><p>The main threat to the species, and the primary reason for its decline in the Western Palearctic, comes from habitat loss and degradation, as a result of dam construction, urbanisation, agricultural expansion, and drainage of wetlands. Although it has adapted to human settlement in many areas, nest disturbance, continuing changes in land use, and collision with utility lines are still potential problems.

It is a brood parasite, which means it lays eggs in the nests of other bird species, particularly of dunnocks, meadow pipits, and reed warblers. Although its eggs are larger than those of its hosts, the eggs in each type of host nest resemble the host's eggs. The adult too is a mimic, in its case of the sparrowhawk; since that species is a predator, the mimicry gives the female time to lay her eggs without being seen to do so.\n</p>\n\n\n<h2><span id=\"Taxonomy\">Taxonomy</span></h2>\n<p>The species' binomial name is derived from the Latin <i>cuculus</i> (the cuckoo) and <i>canorus</i> (melodious; from <i>canere</i>, meaning to sing). The cuckoo family gets its common name and genus name by onomatopoeia for the call of the male common cuckoo. The English word \"cuckoo\" comes from the Old French <i>cucu</i>, and its earliest recorded usage in English is from around 1240, in the song <i>Sumer Is Icumen In</i>. The song is written in Middle English, and the first two lines are: \"Svmer is icumen in / Lhude sing cuccu.\" In modern English, this translates to \"Summer has come in / Loudly sing, Cuckoo!\".</p><p>There are four subspecies worldwide:</p>\n<ul><li><i>C. c. canorus</i>, the nominate subspecies, was first described by Linnaeus in 1758. It occurs from Ireland through Scandinavia, northern Russia and Siberia to Japan in the east, and from the Pyrenees through Turkey, Kazakhstan, Mongolia, northern China and Korea. It winters in Africa and South Asia.</li>\n<li><i>C. c. bakeri</i>, first described by Hartert in 1912, breeds in western China to the Himalayan foothills in northern India, Nepal, Myanmar, northwestern Thailand and southern China. During the winter it is found in Assam, East Bengal and southeastern Asia.</li>\n<li><i>C. c. bangsi</i> was first described by Oberholser in 1919 and breeds in Iberia, the Balearic Islands and North Africa, spending the winter in Africa.</li>\n<li><i>C. c. subtelephonus</i>, first described by Zarudny in 1914, breeds in Central Asia from Turkestan to southern Mongolia. It migrates to southern Asia and Africa for the winter.</li></ul><h2><span id=\"Lifespan_and_demography\">Lifespan and demography</span></h2>\n<p>Although the common cuckoo's global population appears to be declining, it is classified of being of Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. It is estimated that the species numbers between 25 million and 100 million individuals worldwide, with around 12.6 million to 25.8 million of those birds breeding in Europe. The maximum recorded lifespan of a common cuckoo in the United Kingdom is 6 years, 11 months and 2 days.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Description\">Description</span></h2>\n\n<p>The common cuckoo is 32\u201334 centimetres (13\u201313\u00a0in) long from bill to tail (with a tail of 13\u201315 centimetres (5.1\u20135.9\u00a0in) and a wingspan of 55\u201360 centimetres (22\u201324\u00a0in). The legs are short. It has a greyish, slender body and long tail, similar to a sparrowhawk in flight, where the wingbeats are regular. During the breeding season, common cuckoos often settle on an open perch with drooped wings and raised tail. There is a rufous colour morph, which occurs occasionally in adult females but more often in juveniles.</p>\n\n<p>All adult males are slate-grey; the grey throat extends well down the bird's breast with a sharp demarcation to the barred underparts. The iris, orbital ring, the base of the bill and feet are yellow. Grey adult females have a pinkish-buff or buff background to the barring and neck sides, and sometimes small rufous spots on the median and greater coverts and the outer webs of the secondary feathers.</p><p>Rufous morph adult females have reddish-brown upperparts with dark grey or black bars. The black upperpart bars are narrower than the rufous bars, as opposed to rufous juvenile birds, where the black bars are broader.</p><p>Common cuckoos in their first autumn have variable plumage. Some have strongly-barred chestnut-brown upperparts, while others are plain grey. Rufous-brown birds have heavily barred upperparts with some feathers edged with creamy-white. All have whitish edges to the upper wing-coverts and primaries. The secondaries and greater coverts have chestnut bars or spots. In spring, birds hatched in the previous year may retain some barred secondaries and wing-coverts. The most obvious identification features of juvenile common cuckoos are the white nape patch and white feather fringes.</p><p>Common cuckoos moult twice a year: a partial moult in summer and a complete moult in winter. Males weigh around 130 grams (4.6\u00a0oz) and females 110 grams (3.9\u00a0oz). The common cuckoo looks very similar to the Oriental cuckoo, which is slightly shorter-winged on average.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Mimicry_in_adult\">Mimicry in adult</span></h2>\n\n<p>A study using stuffed bird models found that small birds are less likely to approach common cuckoos that have barred underparts similar to the Eurasian sparrowhawk, a predatory bird. Eurasian reed warblers were found more aggressive to cuckoos that looked less hawk-like, meaning that the resemblance to the hawk helps the cuckoo to access the nests of potential hosts. Other small birds, great tits and blue tits, showed alarm and avoided attending feeders on seeing either (mounted) sparrowhawks or cuckoos; this implies that the cuckoo's hawklike appearance functions as protective mimicry, whether to reduce attacks by hawks or to make brood parasitism easier.</p><p>Hosts attack cuckoos more when they see neighbors mobbing cuckoos. The existence of the two plumage morphs in females may be due to frequency-dependent selection if this learning applies only to the morph that hosts see neighbors mob. In an experiment with dummy cuckoos of each morph and a sparrowhawk, reed warblers were more likely to attack both cuckoo morphs than the sparrowhawk, and even more likely to mob a certain cuckoo morph when they saw neighbors mobbing that morph, decreasing the reproductive success of that morph and selecting for the less common morph.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Voice\">Voice</span></h2>\n\n<p>The male's song,  <i>goo-ko</i>, is usually given from an open perch. During the breeding season the male typically gives this vocalisation with intervals of 1\u20131.5 seconds, in groups of 10\u201320 with a rest of a few seconds between groups. The female has a loud bubbling call. The song starts as a descending minor third early in the year in April, and the interval gets wider, through a major third to a fourth as the season progresses, and in June the cuckoo \"forgets its tune\" and may make other calls such as ascending intervals. The wings are drooped when calling intensely and when in the vicinity of a potential female, the male often wags its tail from side to side or the body may pivot from side to side.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Distribution_and_habitat\">Distribution and habitat</span></h2>\n<p>Essentially a bird of open land, the common cuckoo is a widespread summer migrant to Europe and Asia, and winters in Africa. Birds arrive in Europe in April and leave in September. The common cuckoo has also occurred as a vagrant in countries including Barbados, the United States, Greenland, the Faroe Islands, Iceland, Indonesia, Palau, Seychelles, Taiwan and China. Between 1995 and 2015, the distribution of cuckoos within the UK has shifted towards the north, with a decline by 69% in England but an increase by 33% in Scotland.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Behaviour\">Behaviour</span></h2>\n<h3><span id=\"Food_and_feeding\">Food and feeding</span></h3>\n<p>The common cuckoo's diet consists of insects, with hairy caterpillars, which are distasteful to many birds, being a specialty of preference. It also occasionally eats eggs and chicks.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Breeding\">Breeding</span></h2>\n\n\n<p>The common cuckoo is an obligate brood parasite; it lays its eggs in the nests of other birds. At the appropriate moment, the hen cuckoo flies down to the host's nest, pushes one egg out of the nest, lays an egg and flies off. The whole process takes about 10 seconds. A female may visit up to 50 nests during a breeding season. Common cuckoos first breed at the age of two years.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Egg_mimicry\">Egg mimicry</span></h3>\n<p>More than 100 host species have been recorded: meadow pipit, dunnock and Eurasian reed warbler are the most common hosts in northern Europe; garden warbler, meadow pipit, pied wagtail and European robin in central Europe; brambling and common redstart in Finland; and great reed warbler in Hungary.</p><p>Female common cuckoos are divided into gentes \u2013 groups of females favouring a particular host species' nest and laying eggs that match those of that species in color and pattern. Evidence from mitochondrial DNA analyses suggest that each gene may have multiple independent origins due to parasitism of specific hosts by different ancestors. One hypothesis for the inheritance of egg appearance mimicry is that this trait is inherited from the female only, suggesting that it is carried on the sex-determining W chromosome (females are WZ, males ZZ). A genetic analysis of gentes supports this proposal by finding significant differentiation in mitochondrial DNA, but not in microsatellite DNA. A second proposal for the inheritance of this trait is that the genes controlling egg characteristics are carried on autosomes rather than just the W chromosome. Another genetic analysis of sympatric gentes supports this second proposal by finding significant genetic differentiation in both microsatellite DNA and mitochondrial DNA. Considering the tendency for common cuckoo males to mate with multiple females and produce offspring raised by more than one host species, it appears as though males do not contribute to the maintenance of common cuckoo gentes. However, it was found that only nine percent of offspring were raised outside of their father's presumed host species. Therefore, both males and females may contribute to the maintenance of common cuckoo egg mimicry polymorphism. It is notable that most non-parasitic cuckoo species lay white eggs, like most non-passerines other than ground-nesters.\n</p>\n\n<p>As the common cuckoo evolves to lay eggs that better imitate the host's eggs, the host species adapts and is more able to distinguish the cuckoo egg. A study of 248 common cuckoo and host eggs demonstrated that female cuckoos that parasitised common redstart nests laid eggs that matched better than those that targeted dunnocks. Spectroscopy was used to model how the host species saw the cuckoo eggs. Cuckoos that target dunnock nests lay white, brown-speckled eggs, in contrast to the dunnock's own blue eggs. The theory suggests that common redstarts have been parasitised by common cuckoos for longer, and so have evolved to be better than the dunnocks at noticing the cuckoo eggs. The cuckoo, over time, has needed to evolve more accurate mimicking eggs to successfully parasitise the redstart. In contrast, cuckoos do not seem to have experienced evolutionary pressure to develop eggs which closely mimic the dunnock's, as dunnocks do not seem to be able to distinguish between the two species' eggs, despite the significant colour differences. The dunnock's inability to distinguish the eggs suggests that they have not been parasitised for very long, and have not yet evolved defences against it, unlike the redstart.</p><p>Studies performed on great reed warbler nests in central Hungary, showed an <i>\"unusually high\"</i> frequency of common cuckoo parasitism, with 64% of the nests parasitised. Of the nests targeted by cuckoos, 64% contained one cuckoo egg, 23% had two, 10% had three and 3% had four common cuckoo eggs. In total, 58% of the common cuckoo eggs were laid in nests that were multiply parasitised. When laying eggs in nests already parasitised, the female cuckoos removed one egg at random, showing no discrimination between the great reed warbler eggs and those of other cuckoos.</p><p>It was found that nests close to cuckoo perches were most vulnerable: multiple parasitised nests were closest to the vantage points, and unparasitised nests were farthest away. Nearly all the nests <i>\"in close vicinity\"</i> to the vantage points were parasitised. More visible nests were more likely to be selected by the common cuckoos. Female cuckoos use their vantage points to watch for potential hosts and find it easier to locate the more visible nests while they are egg-laying, however, novel studies highlight that host alarm calls might also play an important role during nest searching.</p><p>The great reed warblers' responses to the common cuckoo eggs varied: 66% accepted the egg(s); 12% ejected them; 20% abandoned the nests entirely; 2% buried the eggs. 28% of the cuckoo eggs were described as \"<i>almost perfect</i>\" in their mimesis of the host eggs, and the warblers rejected <i>\"poorly mimetic\"</i> cuckoo eggs more often. The degree of mimicry made it difficult for both the great reed warblers and the observers to tell the eggs apart.</p><p>The egg measures 22 by 16 millimetres (0.87\u00a0in \u00d7\u00a00.63\u00a0in) and weighs 3.2 grams (0.11\u00a0oz), of which 7% is shell. Research has shown that the female common cuckoo is able to keep its egg inside its body for an extra 24 hours before laying it in a host's nest. This means the cuckoo chick can hatch before the host's chicks do, and it can eject the unhatched eggs from the nest. Scientists incubated common cuckoo eggs for 24 hours at the bird's body temperature of 40\u00a0\u00b0C (104\u00a0\u00b0F), and examined the embryos, which were found \"much more advanced\" than those of other species studied. The idea of 'internal incubation' was first put forward in 1802 and 18th and 19th Century egg collectors had reported finding that cuckoo embryos were more advanced than those of the host species.</p><p>Complete list of common cuckoo's nest-host by Aleksander D. Numerov (2003); names of birds in whose nests cuckoo's eggs and chicks were found more than 10 times (in <b>bold</b>):</p>\n\n<h3><span id=\"Chicks\">Chicks</span></h3>\n<p>The naked, altricial chick hatches after 11\u201313 days. It methodically evicts all host progeny from host nests. It is a much larger bird than its hosts, and needs to monopolize the food supplied by the parents. The chick will roll the other eggs out of the nest by pushing them with its back over the edge. If the host's eggs hatch before the cuckoo's, the cuckoo chick will push the other chicks out of the nest in a similar way. At 14 days old, the common cuckoo chick is about three times the size of an adult Eurasian reed warbler.\n</p><p>The necessity of eviction behavior is unclear. One hypothesis is that competing with host chicks leads to decreased cuckoo chick weight, which is selective pressure for eviction behavior. An analysis of the amount of food provided to common cuckoo chicks by host parents in the presence and absence of host siblings showed that when competing against host siblings, cuckoo chicks did not receive enough food, showing an inability to compete. Selection pressure for eviction behavior may come from cuckoo chicks lacking the correct visual begging signals, hosts distributing food to all nestlings equally, or host recognition of the parasite. Another hypothesis is that decreased cuckoo chick weight is not selective pressure for eviction behavior. An analysis of resources provided to cuckoo chick in the presence and absence of host siblings also showed that the weights of cuckoos raised with host chicks were much smaller upon fledging than cuckoos raised alone, but within 12 days cuckoos raised with siblings grew faster than cuckoos raised alone and made up for developmental differences, showing a flexibility that would not necessarily select for eviction behavior.</p><p>Species whose broods are parasitised by the common cuckoo have evolved to discriminate against cuckoo eggs but not chicks. Experiments have shown that common cuckoo chicks persuade their host parents to feed them by making a rapid begging call that sounds <i>\"remarkably like a whole brood of host chicks.\"</i> The researchers suggested that <i>\"the cuckoo needs vocal trickery to stimulate adequate care to compensate for the fact that it presents a visual stimulus of just one gape.\"</i> However, a cuckoo chick needs the amount of food of a whole brood of host nestlings, and it struggles to elicit that much from the host parents with only the vocal stimulus. This may reflect a tradeoff\u2014the cuckoo chick benefits from eviction by receiving all the food provided, but faces a cost in being the only one influencing feeding rate. For this reason, cuckoo chicks exploit host parental care by remaining with the host parent longer than host chicks do, both before and after fledging.</p><p>Common cuckoo chicks fledge about 17\u201321 days after hatching, compared to 12\u201313 days for Eurasian reed warblers. If the hen cuckoo is out-of-phase with a clutch of Eurasian reed warbler eggs, she will eat them all so that the hosts are forced to start another brood.\n</p><p>The common cuckoo's behaviour was firstly observed and described by Aristotle and the combination of behaviour and anatomical adaptation by Edward Jenner, who was elected as Fellow of the Royal Society in 1788 for this work rather than for his development of the smallpox vaccine. It was first documented on film in 1922 by Edgar Chance and Oliver G Pike, in their film 'The Cuckoo's Secret'.</p><p>A study in Japan found that young common cuckoos probably acquire species-specific feather lice from body-to-body contact with other cuckoos between the time of leaving the nest and returning to the breeding area in spring. A total of 21 nestlings were examined shortly before they left their hosts' nests and none carried feather lice. However, young birds returning to Japan for the first time were found just as likely as older individuals to be lousy.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"As_a_biodiversity_indicator\">As a biodiversity indicator</span></h2>\n<p>The occurrence of common cuckoo in Europe is a good surrogate for biodiversity facets including taxonomic diversity and functional diversity in bird communities, and better than the traditional use of top predators as bioindicators. The reason for this is the strong correlation between the cuckoo's host species richness and overall bird species richness, due to co-evolutionary relationships. This may be useful for citizen science.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"In_culture\">In culture</span></h2>\n\n<p>Aristotle was aware of the old tale that cuckoos turned into hawks in winter. The tale was an explanation for their absence outside the summer season, later accepted by Pliny the Elder in his <i>Natural History</i>. Aristotle rejected the claim, observing in his <i>History of Animals</i> that cuckoos do not have the predators' talons or hooked bills. These Classical era accounts were known to the Early Modern English naturalist, William Turner.</p><p>The  13th century medieval English round, \"Sumer Is Icumen In\", celebrates the cuckoo as a sign of spring, the beginning of summer, in the first stanza, and in the chorus:</p>\n\n<p>In England, William Shakespeare alludes to the common cuckoo's association with spring, and with cuckoldry, in the courtly springtime song in his play <i>Love's Labours Lost</i>:</p>\n<dl><dd>When daisies pied and violets blue\n<dl><dd><dl><dd>And lady-smocks all silver-white</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd>\n<dd>And cuckoo-buds of yellow hue\n<dl><dd><dl><dd>Do paint the meadows with delight,</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd>\n<dd>The cuckoo then, on every tree,</dd>\n<dd>Mocks married men; for thus sings he:\u00a0\n<dl><dd><dl><dd>\"Cuckoo;</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd>\n<dd>Cuckoo, cuckoo!\" O, word of fear,\n<dl><dd><dl><dd>Unpleasing to a married ear!</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl><p>In Europe, hearing the call of the common cuckoo is regarded as the first harbinger of spring. Many local legends and traditions are based on this.  In Scotland, Gowk Stones (cuckoo stones) sometimes associated with the arrival of the first cuckoo of spring. \"Gowk\" is an old name for the common cuckoo in northern England, derived from the harsh repeated <i>\"gowk\"</i> call the bird makes when excited. The well-known cuckoo clock features a mechanical bird and is fitted with bellows and pipes that imitate the call of the common cuckoo. Cuckoos feature in traditional rhymes, such as '\"In April the cuckoo comes, In May she'll stay, In June she changes her tune, In July she prepares to fly, Come August, go she must,\"' quoted Peggy. 'But you haven't said it all,' put in Bobby. '\"And if the cuckoo stays till September, It's as much as the oldest man can remember.\"'</p><p><i>On Hearing the First Cuckoo in Spring</i> is a Symphonic poem from Norway composed for orchestra by Frederick Delius.</p><p>Two English folk songs feature cuckoos. One usually called <i>The Cuckoo</i> starts:\n</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The cuckoo is a fine bird and she sings as she flies,<br> \nShe brings us good tidings, she tells us no lies.<br>\nShe sucks little birds' eggs to make her voice clear,<br>\nAnd never sings cuckoo till the summer draws near<br></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The second, \"The Cuckoo's Nest\" is a song about a courtship, with the eponymous (and of course, non-existent) nest serving as a metaphor for the vulva and its tangled \"nest\" of pubic hair.\n</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Some like a girl who is pretty in the face<br>\nand some like a girl who is slender in the waist<br>\nBut give me a girl who will wriggle and will twist<br>\nAt the bottom of the belly lies the cuckoo's nest...<br></p><p>...Me darling, says she, I can do no such thing<br>\nFor me mother often told me it was committing sin<br>\nMe maidenhead to lose and me sex to be abused<br>\nSo have no more to do with me cuckoo's nest<br></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>One of the tales of the Wise Men of Gotham tells how they built a hedge round a tree in order to trap a cuckoo so that it would always be summer.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n\n<h2><span id=\"Further_reading\">Further reading</span></h2>\n<ul><li><cite id=\"CITEREFWyllie1981\" class=\"citation book\">Wyllie, Ian (1981). <i>The Cuckoo</i>.

The species name is derived from the Latin <i>clangere</i> (\"to resound\").</p><p>Common goldeneyes are aggressive and territorial ducks, and have elaborate courtship displays.</p>\n\n\n<h2><span id=\"Description\">Description</span></h2>\n<p>Adult males ranges from 45\u201351\u00a0cm (18\u201320\u00a0in) and weigh approximately 1,000\u00a0g (2.2\u00a0lb), while females range from 40\u201350\u00a0cm (16\u201320\u00a0in) and weigh approximately 800\u00a0g (1.8\u00a0lb). The species is named for its golden-yellow eye. Adult males have a dark head with a greenish gloss and a circular white patch below the eye, a dark back and a white neck and belly. Adult females have a brown head and a mostly grey body. Their legs and feet are orange-yellow.\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Habitat_and_breeding\">Habitat and breeding</span></h2>\n<p>Their breeding habitat is the taiga. They are found in the lakes and rivers of boreal forests across Canada and the northern United States, Scandinavia, the Baltic States, and northern Russia. They are migratory and most winter in protected coastal waters or open inland waters at more temperate latitudes. Naturally, they nest in cavities in large trees, where they return year after year, though they will readily use nest boxes as well.</p><p>Natural tree cavities chosen for nest sites include those made by broken limbs and those made by large woodpeckers, specifically pileated woodpeckers or black woodpeckers. Average egg size is a breadth of 42.6\u201344.0\u00a0mm (1.68\u20131.73\u00a0in), a length of 58.1\u201360.6\u00a0mm (2.29\u20132.39\u00a0in) and a weight of 61.2\u201366.6\u00a0g (2.16\u20132.35\u00a0oz). The incubation period ranges from 28 to 32 days. The female does all the incubating and is abandoned by the male about 1 to 2 weeks into incubation. The young remain in the nest for about 24\u201336 hours. Brood parasitism is quite common with other common goldeneyes, and occurs less frequently with other duck species. The broods commonly start to mix with other females' broods as they become more independent or are abandoned by their mothers. Goldeneye young have been known to be competitively killed by other goldeneye mothers, common loons and red-necked grebes. The young are capable of flight at 55\u201365 days of age.\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Diet\">Diet</span></h2>\n<p>Common goldeneyes are diving birds that forage underwater. Year-round, about 32% of their prey is crustaceans, 28% is aquatic insects and 10% is molluscs. Insects are the predominant prey while nesting and crustaceans are the predominant prey during migration and winter. Locally, fish eggs and aquatic plants can be important foods. They themselves may fall prey to various hawks, owls and eagles, while females and their broods have been preyed upon by bears (<i>Ursus</i> spp.), various weasels (<i>Mustela</i> spp.), mink (<i>Mustela vison</i>), raccoons (<i>Procyon lotor</i>) and even northern flickers (<i>Colaptes auratus</i>) and red squirrels (<i>Tamiasciurus husonicus</i>).\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Conservation\">Conservation</span></h2>\n<p>The common goldeneye is one of the species to which the <i>Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds</i> (AEWA) applies. Approximately 188,300 common goldeneyes were killed annually by duck hunters in North America during the 1970s, representing slightly less than 4% of the total waterfowl killed in Canada during that period, and less than 1% of the total waterfowl killed in the US. Both the breeding and winter habitat of these birds has been degraded by clearance and pollution. However, the common goldeneye in North America is known to derive short-term benefits from lake acidification.</p>\n\n<h2><span id=\"Gallery\">Gallery</span></h2>\n<ul class=\"gallery mw-gallery-traditional\"><li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 235px\">\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 235px\">\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 235px\">\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 235px\">\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 235px\">\n</ul><h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n\n<h2><span id=\"External_links\">External links</span></h2>\n<ul><li><cite class=\"citation web\">\"Common goldeneye media\". <i>Internet Bird Collection</i>.</cite><span title=\"ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rft.genre=unknown&amp;rft.jtitle=Internet+Bird+Collection&amp;rft.atitle=Common+goldeneye+media&amp;rft_id=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.hbw.com%2Fibc%2Fspecies%2Fcommon-goldeneye-bucephala-clangula&amp;rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fen.wikipedia.org%3ACommon+goldeneye\"></span><link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r951705291\"></li>\n<li>Common Goldeneye Species Account \u2013 Cornell Lab of Ornithology</li>\n<li>Common Goldeneye - <i>Bucephala clangula</i> - USGS Patuxent Bird Identification InfoCenter</li>\n<li>eNature.com: Common Goldeneye</li>\n<li>Common Goldeneye wildlife photos and voice at nature-photos.org</li>\n<li>Feathers of Common Goldeneye (Bucephala clangula) at ornithos.de</li>\n<li>Common goldeneye photo gallery at VIREO (Drexel University)</li>\n<li>Interactive range map of <i>Bucephala clangula</i> at IUCN Red List maps</li></ul> "

It breeds across much of temperate Europe and the western Palearctic. It is migratory, wintering in north and west Africa.\n</p><p>This small passerine bird is found in short dense vegetation, often close to water. It is a medium-sized warbler about 13\u00a0cm (5\u00a0in) long. The adult has a streaked brown back and whitish grey underparts which are unstreaked except on the undertail coverts. The sexes are identical, as with most warblers, but young birds are yellower below. Like most warblers, it is insectivorous. Four to seven eggs are laid in a nest on or near the ground in thick vegetation or in a tussock of grass.\n</p><p>This is a species which skulks in the undergrowth, creeping through bushes and low foliage, and which is very difficult to see except sometimes when singing from a prominent position. The song, which gives this species its name, is a monotonous mechanical insect-like reeling, often given at dawn or dusk.\n</p><p><br></p>\n\n\n<h2><span id=\"Taxonomy\">Taxonomy</span></h2>\n<p>The Italian naturalist Ulisse Aldrovandi included the common grasshopper warbler in the second volume of his <i>Ornithologiae</i>. Aldrovandi died in 1605 but the volume was not published until 1637. In 1760 the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson included a detailed description of the common grasshopper warbler in his <i>Ornithologie</i>. He used the French name <i>La fauvette tachet\u00e9e</i> and the Latin name <i>Curruca naevia</i> but although Brisson coined Latin names, these do not conform to the binomial system and are not recognised by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature.</p><p>The common grasshopper warbler was described by the French polymath Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon in 1779 in his <i>Histoire Naturelle des Oiseaux</i>. The bird was also illustrated in a hand-coloured plate engraved by Fran\u00e7ois-Nicolas Martinet in the <i>Planches Enlumin\u00e9es D'Histoire Naturelle</i> which was produced under the supervision of Edme-Louis Daubenton to accompany Buffon's text.  Neither the plate caption nor Buffon's description included a scientific name but in 1783 the Dutch naturalist Pieter Boddaert coined the binomial name <i>Motacilla naevia</i> in his catalogue of the <i>Planches Enlumin\u00e9es</i>; he used the word <i>naevia</i> that had earlier been used by Brisson. \nThe type locality is Bologna in Italy. The common grasshopper warbler is now one of 20 species placed in the genus <i>Locustella</i> that was introduced by the German naturalist Johann Jakob Kaup in 1829 with the common grasshopper warbler as the type species. The genus name <i>Locustella</i> is from Latin and is a diminutive of <i>locusta</i>,  \"grasshopper\". The specific <i>naevia</i> is Latin for \"spotted \".</p><p>Three subspecies are recognised.</p>\n<ul><li><i>L. n. naevia</i> (Boddaert, 1783) \u2013 Europe to west European Russia and Ukraine; wintering in West Africa</li>\n<li><i>L. n. straminea</i> Seebohm, 1881 \u2013 east European Russia to southwest, south central Siberia, east Kazakhstan, west Mongolia and northwest China; wintering in south Asia</li>\n<li><i>L. n. obscurior</i> Buturlin, 1929 \u2013 east Turkey and the Caucasus</li></ul><h2><span id=\"Description\">Description</span></h2>\n<p>The adult common grasshopper warbler (the name is the IOC recommended English name) has a length of about 12.5\u00a0cm (5\u00a0in). It is a very secretive bird and seldom seen, but its presence is easily detected because of its characteristic song. The upper-parts are pale olive-brown, each feather having a central darker brown streak. The cheeks are greyish, the irises are brown and there is a faint eye streak behind the eye. The upper mandible of the beak is dark brown and the lower mandible yellowish-brown. The underparts are cream-coloured or yellowish-buff with a few dark brown spots and streaks on the breast and flanks. The wings are brown with the outer edge of the feathers rimmed with paler brown. The tail feathers are reddish-brown with faint transverse bars being visible in some individuals and the under-tail coverts are streaked. The slender legs and the feet are pale yellowish-brown.</p>\n\n<p>The song is an unmusical long, high-pitched reeling trill performed with beak held wide open and the whole body vibrating. It lasts for from a few seconds to two or three minutes with hardly a pause for breath. It varies in volume from a faint hum to a sound resembling a distant mowing machine. It is performed at any time of day from early morning until after the sun has set and is constantly to be heard from the arrival of the bird in spring until late July. The alarm call is a repeated ticking noise that has been rendered as \"twkit-twkit-twkit\". The song is similar to that of its congeners: the lanceolated warbler (<i>Locustella lanceolata</i>), Savi's warbler (<i>Locustella luscinioides</i>) and the river warbler (<i>Locustella fluviatilis</i>).</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Distribution_and_habitat\">Distribution and habitat</span></h2>\n<p>The common grasshopper warbler breeds in north west Europe and the western Palearctic. The range includes Spain, France, central Italy, Romania, Yugoslavia, the British Isles, Belgium, Netherlands, Germany, Denmark, southern Sweden, southern Finland, the Baltic States and western parts of Russia. Further east it is replaced by related species. In late summer, it migrates to north west Africa, India and Sri Lanka where it overwinters.</p><p>In the breeding season, the common grasshopper warbler is found in damp or dry places with rough grass and bushes such as the edges of fens, clearings, neglected hedgerows, heaths, upland moors, gorse-covered areas, young plantations and felled woodland. In the winter, it is usually found in similar locations but information is scarce on its behaviour and habitat at this time.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Behaviour\">Behaviour</span></h2>\n\n<p>This bird seldom takes to the wing but spends its time scurrying through dense vegetation, flitting from twig to twig or running along the ground. It has a peculiar high-stepping gait and long stride as it moves along horizontal stems, looking slender and tapering. It seldom flies, soon diving back into cover, and when it alights it often raises and flares its tail to show its streaked under-tail coverts. It has been known to feign injury in order to distract a potential predator.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Breeding\">Breeding</span></h3>\n\n<p>Male common grasshopper warblers try to attract females by displaying to them. They walk or run along twigs with tail spread, fluttering their wings as they raise and lower them, often carrying a grass or leaf in their beak. In the air, with wings well extended and fluttering, they spread their tail and fluff their feathers.</p><p>Both sexes take part in nest-building. The nest is well-concealed and built close to the ground in such places as grass tussocks, gorse bushes, osier beds, reed beds, tangled hedgerows, scrub and among coarse heather plants on moorland. It varies in size and shape but is constructed of grasses, sedges and mosses and often lined with fine grasses. A clutch of four to six eggs is laid. These are creamy white speckled with fine reddish spots, usually randomly distributed but sometimes merged into blotches or zones. The eggs measure 18 by 14 millimetres (0.71 by 0.55\u00a0in) and weigh about 1.7\u00a0g (0.06\u00a0oz). Both parents are involved in incubating the eggs which takes about fourteen days. The chicks are altricial and are fed on insects. They fledge in twelve to thirteen days and there are usually two broods in the season. Young birds become mature at a year old and the highest recorded age for this species is five years.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Food_and_feeding\">Food and feeding</span></h3>\n<p>The common grasshopper warbler is insectivorous, feeding on a wide range of invertebrates. Its diet includes flies, moths, beetles, aphids, dragonflies and mayflies and their larvae. Spiders and woodlice are also eaten and the chicks are fed on aphids, green caterpillars, woodlice and flies.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Status\">Status</span></h2>\n<p>The common grasshopper warbler is assessed by the IUCN in their Red List of Threatened Species as being of \"Least Concern\". This is because it has a large total population and an extensive range. The population in Europe is estimated to be between 840 thousand and 2.2 million breeding pairs with a total of 2.52 to 6.6 million individuals. As Europe amounts to about two thirds of its total range, the world population is estimated to be in the region of 3.41 to 13.2 million individuals. The total number of birds may be on the decline because of habitat loss, but not to an extent that would warrant listing the bird under a higher risk category. In a study examining the possible effects of global warming on the range of various species of bird, it was estimated that the breeding range of the common grasshopper warbler would be displaced several hundred miles northwards and would cover the British Isles and the whole of Scandinavia but that it would cease to breed in much of its present range in mainland Europe.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n\n<h2><span id=\"Further_reading\">Further reading</span></h2>\n<ul><li><cite id=\"CITEREFCramp1992\" class=\"citation book\">Cramp, Stanley;  et al., eds.

It bears a close resemblance to the Shikra, even in its style of flying and landing on a perch. The resemblance to hawks gives this group the generic name of hawk-cuckoo and like many other cuckoos these are brood parasites, laying their eggs in nests of babblers. During their breeding season in summer males produce loud, repetitive three note calls that are well-rendered as <i>brain-fever</i>, the second note being longer and higher pitched. These notes rise to a crescendo before ending abruptly and repeat after a few minutes; the calling may go on through the day, well after dusk and before dawn.\n</p>\n\n\n<h2><span id=\"Description\">Description</span></h2>\n\n<p>The common hawk-cuckoo is a medium- to large-sized cuckoo, about the size of a pigeon (ca. 34\u00a0cm).  The plumage is ashy grey above; whitish below, cross-barred with brown. The tail is broadly barred. The sexes are alike. They have a distinctive yellow eye ring. Subadults have the breast streaked, similar to the immature shikra, and there are large brown chevron marks on the belly. At first glance they can be mistaken for a hawk. When flying they use a flap and glide style that resembles that of sparrowhawks (especially the shikra) and flying upwards and landing on a perch they shake their tails from side to side. Many small birds and squirrels raise the alarm just as they would in the presence of a hawk. The sexes are alike but males tend to be larger.</p><p>They can be confused with the large hawk-cuckoo, which, however, has dark streaks on the throat and breast. Young birds have a pale chin but young large hawk-cuckoos have a black chin.</p>\n\n<p>During summer months, before the monsoons, the males are easily detected by their repeated calls but can be difficult to spot. The call is a loud screaming three-note call, repeated 5 or 6 times, rising in crescendo and ending abruptly. It is heard throughout the day and frequently during moonlit nights. The calls of females are a series of grating notes. Common hawk-cuckoos feed mainly on insects and are specialised feeders that can handle hairy caterpillars. Caterpillar guts often contain toxins and like many cuckoos they remove the guts by pressing the caterpillar and rubbing it on a branch before swallowing it. The hairs are swallowed with the caterpillar and are separated in the stomach and regurgitated as a pellet.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Taxonomy_and_systematics\">Taxonomy and systematics</span></h2>\n<p>The type locality of the species is Tranquebar in Tamil Nadu, once a Danish settlement and from where a specimen reached Martin Hendriksen Vahl who described the species in 1797. This species is placed under the genus <i>Hierococcyx</i>, which includes other hawk-cuckoos, but is sometimes included in the genus <i>Cuculus</i>.\nThere are two subspecies, the nominate from India and <i>ciceliae</i> of the hill regions of Sri Lanka. The Indian population has paler plumage than <i>ciceliae</i>.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Distribution\">Distribution</span></h2>\n<p>The common hawk-cuckoo occurs in most of the Indian subcontinent, from Pakistan in the west, across the Himalayas foothills, east to Nepal, Bhutan and Bangladesh and south into Sri Lanka. Some birds of the Indian population winter in Sri Lanka. In the hills of central Sri Lanka, <i>ciceliae</i> is a resident. It is generally resident but where occurring at high altitudes and in arid areas is locally migratory. It is found in the lower elevations (mostly below 1000m) of the Himalayas but in the higher areas, the large hawk-cuckoo tends to be more common.</p><p>The species is arboreal and rarely descends to the ground. Its habitat includes garden land, groves of tree, deciduous and semi-evergreen forests.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Behaviour_and_ecology\">Behaviour and ecology</span></h2>\n\n<p>Like many other cuckoos, this species is a brood parasite, preferring babblers mainly in the genus <i>Turdoides</i> (possibly the only host) and also reportedly on laughing-thrushes of the genus <i>Garrulax</i>.</p><p>Its breeding season is March to June, coinciding with that of some of the <i>Turdoides</i> babblers. A single egg is laid in each nest, blue, like that of the host. The hatchling usually evicts the eggs of its host and is reared to maturity by foster parents, following them for nearly a month. T C Jerdon noted that it may not always evict the host and that young birds may be seen along with young babblers. When moving with a flock of babblers the chick makes a grating <i>kee-kee</i> call to beg for food and the foster parents within the group may feed it. The predominant host species in India are <i>Turdoides striatus</i> and <i>Turdoides affinis</i>. Hawk-cuckoos also parasitise the large grey babbler <i>Turdoides malcolmi</i>. In Sri Lanka, their host is <i>Turdoides striatus</i>.</p><p>Parasitic eye-worms in the genus <i>Oxyspirura</i> have been found in the orbital cavity of the species.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"In_culture\">In culture</span></h2>\n<p>The call of this bird has been popularly transcribed as <i>brain-fever</i> in English (in some old books, this name is also incorrectly used for the Asian koel). Frank Finn noted that <i>[H]is note, however, fully entitles him to his ordinary designation, whether from its \"damnable iteration\" or from its remarkable resemblance to the word \"brain-fever\" repeated in a piercing voice running up the scale</i>. Other interpretations of the bird call include <i>piyaan kahan</i> in Hindi (\"where's my love\") or <i>chokh gelo</i> (in Bengali, \"my eyes are gone\"), <i>moi keteki</i> in Assamese (\"I am Keteki\", Keteki being the Assamese name for the bird) and <i>paos ala</i> (Marathi, \"the rains are coming\").\n</p><p>The call \"Pee kahan\" or \"Papeeha\" is more accurately represented by the shrill screaming \"pi-peeah\" of the large hawk-cuckoo <i>Hierococcyx sparverioides</i>, which replaces the brainfever bird along the Himalayas and its foothills.</p><p>The brainfever bird's call may be heard all through the day, starting early before dawn and frequently during moonlit nights. A novel by the Indian author Allan Sealy is named after this bird.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n\n<h2><span id=\"Other_sources\">Other sources</span></h2>\n<ul><li><cite id=\"CITEREFWhistler,_H1918\" class=\"citation journal\">Whistler, H (1918). \"The Common Hawk-Cuckoo <i>Hierococcyx varius</i> in the Punjab\". <i>J.

It is a member of the starling family (Sturnidae), resident in hill regions of South Asia and Southeast Asia. The Sri Lanka hill myna, a former subspecies of <i>G. religiosa</i>, is now generally accepted as a separate species <i>G. ptilogenys</i>. The Enggano hill myna (<i>G. enganensis</i>) and Nias hill myna (<i>G. robusta</i>) are also widely accepted as specifically distinct, and many authors favor treating the southern hill myna (<i>G. indica</i>) from the Nilgiris and elsewhere in the Western Ghats of India as a separate species.\n</p>\n\n\n<h2><span id=\"Description\">Description</span></h2>\n<p>This is a stocky jet-black myna, with bright orange-yellow patches of naked skin and fleshy wattles on the side of its head and nape. At about 29\u00a0cm length, it is somewhat larger than the common myna (<i>Acridotheres tristis</i>).</p><p>It is overall green-glossed black plumage, purple-tinged on the head and neck. Its large, white wing patches are obvious in flight, but mostly covered when the bird is sitting. The bill and strong legs are bright yellow, and there are yellow wattles on the nape and under the eye. These differ conspicuously in shape from the naked eye-patch of the common myna and bank myna (<i>A. ginginianus</i>), and more subtly vary between the different hill mynas from South Asia: in the common hill myna, they extend from the eye to the nape, where they join, while the Sri Lanka hill myna has a single wattle across the nape and extending a bit towards the eyes. In the southern hill myna, the wattles are separate and curve towards the top of the head. The Nias and Enggano hill mynas differ in details of the facial wattles, and size, particularly that of the bill.</p><p>Sexes are similar; juveniles have a duller bill.</p><p>With the southern, Nias and Enggano hill mynas as separate species, the common hill myna, <i>Gracula religiosa</i>, has seven or eight subspecies, which differ only slightly. They are:</p>\n<ul><li><i>G. r. andamanensis</i> <small>Beavan 1867</small> \u2013 the <b>Andaman hill myna</b>; the Andaman Islands, the central (Nancowry) group of the Nicobar Islands</li>\n<li><i>G. r. batuensis</i> \u2013 the <b>Batu hill myna</b>; the Batu and Mentawai Islands</li>\n<li><i>G. r. halibrecta</i> <small>Oberholser 1926</small> \u2013 the <b>Great Nicobar hill myna</b>; Great Nicobar, Little Nicobar and adjacent islets in the Nicobar Islands; doubtfully distinct from <i>G. r. andamanensis</i></li>\n<li><i>G. r. intermedia</i> \u2013 northwestern Indochina and adjacent northeastern India and southern China</li>\n<li><i>G. r. palawanensis</i> \u2013 the <b>Palawan hill myna</b>; Palawan in the Philippines</li>\n<li><i>G. r. peninsularis</i> \u2013 the <b>Bastar hill mynah</b>; central India (the state bird of Chhattisgarh, India)</li>\n<li><i>G. r. religiosa</i> \u2013 the <b>eastern hill myna</b>; the Greater Sundas (except Sulawesi) and Peninsular Malaysia</li>\n<li><i>G. r. venerata</i> \u2013 the <b>Tenggara hill myna</b>;  the western Lesser Sundas</li></ul><h3><span id=\"Vocalisations\">Vocalisations</span></h3>\n\n<p>The common hill myna is often detected by its loud, shrill, descending whistles followed by other calls. It is most vocal at dawn and dusk, when it is found in small groups in forest clearings high in the canopy.</p><p>Both sexes can produce an extraordinarily wide range of loud calls \u2013 whistles, wails, screeches, and gurgles, sometimes melodious and often very human-like in quality. Each individual has a repertoire of three to 13 such call types, which may be shared with some near neighbours of the same sex, being learned when young.  Dialects change rapidly with distance, such that birds living more than 15\u00a0km apart have no call-types in common with one another.</p><p>Unlike some other birds, such as the greater racket-tailed drongo (<i>Dicrurus paradiseus</i>), the common hill myna does not imitate other birds in the wild, although it is a widely held misconception that they do. On the other hand, in captivity, they are among the most renowned mimics, perhaps on par only with the grey parrot (<i>Psittacus erithacus</i>). They can learn to reproduce many everyday sounds, particularly the human voice, and even whistled tunes, with astonishing accuracy and clarity.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Distribution_and_ecology\">Distribution and ecology</span></h2>\n\n<p>This myna is a resident breeder from Kumaon division in India (80\u00b0 E longitude) east through Nepal, Sikkim, Bhutan and Arunachal Pradesh, the lower Himalayas, terai and foothills up to 2,000 m ASL. Its range continues east through Southeast Asia northeastwards to southern China, and via Thailand southeastwards across northern Indonesia to Palawan in the Philippines. It is virtually extinct in Bangladesh due to habitat destruction and overexploitation for the pet trade. A feral population on Christmas Island has likewise disappeared. Introduced populations exist in Saint Helena, Puerto Rico and perhaps in the mainland United States and possibly elsewhere; feral birds require at least a warm subtropical climate to persist.</p><p>This myna is almost entirely arboreal, moving in large, noisy groups of half a dozen or so, in tree-tops at the edge of the forest. It hops sideways along the branch, unlike the characteristic jaunty walk of other mynas. Like most starlings, the hill myna is fairly omnivorous, eating fruit, nectar and insects.</p><p>They build a nest in a hole in a tree. The usual clutch is two or three eggs. There is no sexual dimorphism in these birds, which results in a limited possibility of choosing the sex to work with for mating.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Pet_trade_and_conservation\">Pet trade and conservation</span></h3>\n\n\n<p>The hill mynas are popular cage birds, renowned for their ability to imitate speech. The widely distributed common hill myna is the one most frequently seen in aviculture. Demand outstrips captive breeding capacity, so they are rarely found in pet stores and usually purchased directly from breeders or importers who can certify the birds are traded legally.</p><p>This species is widely distributed and locally common, and if adult stocks are safeguarded, it is able to multiply quickly. On a worldwide scale, the IUCN thus considers the common hill myna a Species of Least Concern. But in the 1990s, nearly 20,000 wild-caught birds, mostly adults and juveniles, were brought into trade each year. In the central part of its range, <i>G. r. intermedia</i> populations have declined markedly, especially in Thailand, which supplied much of the thriving Western market. Its neighbor countries, from where exports were often limited due to political or military reasons, nevertheless supplied a burgeoning domestic demand, and demand in the entire region continues to be very high. In 1992, Thailand had the common hill myna put on CITES Appendix III, to safeguard its stocks against collapsing. In 1997, at the request of the Netherlands and the Philippines, the species was uplisted to CITES Appendix II. The Andaman and Nicobar Islands subspecies <i>G. r. andamanensis</i> and (if valid) <i>G. r. halibrecta</i>, described as \"exceedingly common\" in 1874, qualified as Near Threatened in 1991. The former is not at all common anymore in the Nicobar Islands and the latter\u2014if distinct\u2014has a very limited range.</p><p>Elsewhere, such as on the Philippines and in Laos, the decline has been more localized. It is also becoming increasingly rare in the regions of northeastern India due to capture of fledged birds for the illegal pet trade. In the Garo Hills region, however, the locals make artificial nests of a split-bamboo framework covered with grass, and put them up in accessible positions in tall trees in a forest clearing or at the edge of a small village to entice the mynas to breed there. The villagers are thus able to extract the young at the proper time for easy hand-rearing, making common hill myna farming a profitable, small-scale cottage industry. It helps to preserve the environment, because the breeding birds are not removed from the population, while habitat destruction is curtailed because the mynas will desert areas of extensive logging and prefer more natural forest to plantations. As the mynas can be somewhat of a pest of fruit trees when too numerous, an additional benefit to the locals is the inexpensive means of controlling the myna population: failing stocks can be bolstered by putting out more nests than can be harvested, while the maximum proportion of nestlings are taken when the population becomes too large.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"See_also\">See also</span></h2>\n<ul><li>Talking birds</li></ul><h2><span id=\"Footnotes\">Footnotes</span></h2>\n\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n<ul><li>Ali, Salim &amp; Sidney Dillon Ripley (1983).

A close relationship between the hoopoe and the wood hoopoes is also supported by the shared and unique nature of their stapes. In the Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy, the hoopoe is separated from the Coraciiformes as a separate order, the Upupiformes. Some authorities place the wood hoopoes in the Upupiformes as well. Now the consensus is that both hoopoe and the wood hoopoes belong with the hornbills in the Bucerotiformes.</p><p>The fossil record of the hoopoes is very incomplete, with the earliest fossil coming from the Quaternary.  The fossil record of their relatives is older, with fossil wood hoopoes dating back to the Miocene and those of an extinct related family, the Messelirrisoridae, dating from the Eocene.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Species\">Species</span></h3>\n<p>Formerly considered a single species, the hoopoe has been split into three separate species: the Eurasian hoopoe, Madagascan hoopoe  and the resident African hoopoe.  One accepted separate species, the Saint Helena hoopoe, lived on the island of St Helena but became extinct in the 16th century, presumably due to introduced species.</p><p>The genus <i>Upupa</i> was created by Linnaeus in his <i>Systema naturae</i> in 1758. It then included three other species with long curved bills:</p>\n<ul><li><i>U. eremita</i> (now <i>Geronticus eremita</i>), the northern bald ibis</li>\n<li><i>U. pyrrhocorax</i> (now <i>Pyrrhocorax pyrrhocorax</i>), the red-billed chough</li>\n<li><i>U. paradisea</i></li></ul><p>Formerly, the greater hoopoe-lark was also considered to be a member of this genus (as <i>Upupa alaudipes</i>).</p>\n<h4><span id=\"Extant_species\">Extant species</span></h4>\n<h2><span id=\"Distribution_and_habitat\">Distribution and habitat</span></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Hoopoes are widespread in Europe, Asia, and North Africa, Sub-Saharan Africa and Madagascar. Most European and north Asian birds migrate to the tropics in winter. In contrast, the African populations are sedentary all year. The species has been a vagrant in Alaska; <i>U. e. saturata</i> was recorded there in 1975 in the Yukon Delta. Hoopoes have been known to breed north of their European range, and in southern England during warm, dry summers that provide plenty of grasshoppers and similar insects, although as of the early 1980s northern European populations were reported to be in the decline, possibly due to changes in climate.</p><p>The hoopoe has two basic requirements of its habitat: bare or lightly vegetated ground on which to forage and vertical surfaces with cavities (such as trees, cliffs or even walls, nestboxes, haystacks, and abandoned burrows) in which to nest. These requirements can be provided in a wide range of ecosystems, and as a consequence the hoopoe inhabits a wide range of habitats such as heathland, wooded steppes, savannas and grasslands, as well as forest glades. The Madagascar subspecies also makes use of more dense primary forest. The modification of natural habitats by humans for various agricultural purposes has led to hoopoes becoming common in olive groves, orchards, vineyards, parkland and farmland, although they are less common and are declining in intensively farmed areas. Hunting is of concern in southern Europe and Asia.</p><p>Hoopoes make seasonal movements in response to rain in some regions such as in Ceylon and in the Western Ghats. Birds have been seen at high altitudes during migration across the Himalayas. One was recorded at about 6,400\u00a0m (21,000\u00a0ft) by the first Mount Everest expedition.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Behaviour_and_ecology\">Behaviour and ecology</span></h2>\n<p>In what was long thought to be a defensive posture, hoopoes sunbathe by spreading out their wings and tail low against the ground and tilting their head up; they often fold their wings and preen halfway through. They also enjoy taking dust and sand baths. Adults may begin their moult after the breeding season and continue after they have migrated for the winter.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Diet_and_feeding\">Diet and feeding</span></h3>\n\n\n<p>The diet of the hoopoe is mostly composed of insects, although small reptiles, frogs and plant matter such as seeds and berries are sometimes taken as well. It is a solitary forager which typically feeds on the ground. More rarely they will feed in the air, where their strong and rounded wings make them fast and manoeuverable, in pursuit of numerous swarming insects. More commonly their foraging style is to stride over relatively open ground and periodically pause to probe the ground with the full length of their bill. Insect larvae, pupae and mole crickets are detected by the bill and either extracted or dug out with the strong feet. Hoopoes will also feed on insects on the surface, probe into piles of leaves, and even use the bill to lever large stones and flake off bark. Common diet items include crickets, locusts, beetles, earwigs, cicadas, ant lions, bugs and ants. These can range from 10 to 150 millimetres (0.4 to 5.9\u00a0in) in length, with a preferred prey size of around 20\u201330 millimetres (0.8\u20131.2\u00a0in). Larger prey items are beaten against the ground or a preferred stone to kill them and remove indigestible body parts such as wings and legs.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Breeding\">Breeding</span></h3>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Hoopoes are monogamous, although the pair bond apparently only lasts for a single season.  They are also territorial. The male calls frequently to advertise his ownership of the territory. Chases and fights between rival males (and sometimes females) are common and can be brutal.  Birds will try to stab rivals with their bills, and individuals are occasionally blinded in fights. The nest is in a hole in a tree or wall, and has a narrow entrance. It may be unlined, or various scraps may be collected. The female alone is responsible for incubating the eggs. Clutch size varies with location: Northern Hemisphere birds lay more eggs than those in the Southern Hemisphere, and birds at higher latitudes have larger clutches than those closer to the equator. In central and northern Europe and Asia the clutch size is around 12, whereas it is around four in the tropics and seven in the subtropics. The eggs are round and milky blue when laid, but quickly discolour in the increasingly dirty nest. They weigh 4.5 grams (0.16\u00a0oz). A replacement clutch is possible.</p><p>Hoopoes have well-developed anti-predator defences in the nest. The uropygial gland of the incubating and brooding female is quickly modified to produce a foul-smelling liquid, and the glands of nestlings do so as well. These secretions are rubbed into the plumage. The secretion, which smells like rotting meat, is thought to help deter predators, as well as deter parasites and possibly act as an antibacterial agent. The secretions stop soon before the young leave the nest. From the age of six days, nestlings can also direct streams of faeces at intruders, and will hiss at them in a snake-like fashion. The young also strike with their bill or with one wing.</p><p>The incubation period for the species is between 15 and 18 days, during which time the male feeds the female. Incubation begins as soon as the first egg is laid, so the chicks are born asynchronously. The chicks hatch with a covering of downy feathers. By around day three to five, feather quills emerge which will become the adult feathers. The chicks are brooded by the female for between 9 and 14 days. The female later joins the male in the task of bringing food. The young fledge in 26 to 29 days and remain with the parents for about a week more.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Relationship_with_humans\">Relationship with humans</span></h2>\n\n\n<p>The diet of the hoopoe includes many species considered by humans to be pests, such as the pupae of the processionary moth, a damaging forest pest. For this reason the species is afforded protection under the law in many countries.</p><p>Hoopoes are distinctive birds and have made a cultural impact over much of their range. They were considered sacred in Ancient Egypt, and were \"depicted on the walls of tombs and temples\". At the Old Kingdom, the hoopoe was used in the iconography as a symbolic code to indicate the child was the heir and successor of his father. They achieved a similar standing in Minoan Crete.</p><p>In the Torah, Leviticus 11:13\u201319, hoopoes were listed among the animals that are detestable and should not be eaten. They are also listed in Deuteronomy as not kosher.</p><p>Hoopoes also appear in the Quran and is known as the \"hudhud\", in Surah Al-Naml 27:20\u201324:  \"And he took attendance of the birds and said, \"Why do I not see the hoopoe - or is he among the absent? (20) I will surely punish him with a severe punishment or slaughter him unless he brings me clear authorization.\" (21) But the hoopoe stayed not long and said, \"I have encompassed [in knowledge] that which you have not encompassed, and I have come to you from Sheba with certain news. (22) Indeed, I found [there] a woman ruling them, and she has been given of all things, and she has a great throne. (23) I found her and her people prostrating to the sun instead of Allah, and Satan has made their deeds pleasing to them and averted them from [His] way, so they are not guided, (24)\".</p><p>The sacredness of the Hoopoe and connection with Solomon and the Queen of Sheba is mentioned in passing in Rudyard Kipling's \"The Butterfly that Stamped.\" \n</p><p>Hoopoes were seen as a symbol of virtue in Persia. A hoopoe was a leader of the birds in the Persian book of poems <i>The Conference of the Birds</i> (\"Mantiq al-Tayr\" by Attar) and when the birds seek a king, the hoopoe points out that the Simurgh was the king of the birds.</p><p>Hoopoes were thought of as thieves across much of Europe, and harbingers of war in Scandinavia. In Estonian tradition, hoopoes are strongly connected with death and the underworld; their song is believed to foreshadow death for many people or cattle.  In medieval ritual magic, the hoopoe was thought to be an evil bird.  The <i>Munich Manual of Demonic Magic</i>, a collection of magical spells compiled in Germany frequently requires the sacrifice of a hoopoe to summon demons and perform other magical intentions.</p><p>Tereus, transformed into the hoopoe, is the king of the birds in the Ancient Greek comedy <i>The Birds</i> by Aristophanes. In Ovid's <i>Metamorphoses</i>, book 6, King Tereus of Thrace rapes Philomela, his wife Procne's sister, and cuts out her tongue. In revenge, Procne kills their son Itys and serves him as a stew to his father. When Tereus sees the boy's head, which is served on a platter, he grabs a sword but just as he attempts to kill the sisters, they are turned into birds\u2014Procne into a swallow and Philomela into a nightingale. Tereus himself is turned into an <i>epops</i> (6.674), translated as <i>lapwing</i> by Dryden and <i>lappewincke</i> (<i>lappewinge</i>) by John Gower in his <i>Confessio Amantis</i>, or <i>hoopoe</i> in A.S. Kline's translation. The bird's crest indicates his royal status, and his long, sharp beak is a symbol of his violent nature. English translators and poets probably had the northern lapwing in mind, considering its crest.\n</p><p>The hoopoe was chosen as the national bird of Israel in May 2008 in conjunction with the country's 60th anniversary, following a national survey of 155,000 citizens, outpolling the white-spectacled bulbul. The hoopoe appears on the logo of the University of Johannesburg and is the official mascot of the university's sports teams. The municipalities of Armstedt and Brechten, Germany, have a hoopoe in their coats of arms.\n</p><p>In Morocco, hoopoes are traded live and as medicinal products in the markets, primarily in herbalist shops. This trade is unregulated and a potential threat to local populations.</p><p>Three CGI enhanced hoopoes, together with other birds collectively named \"the tittifers\", are often shown whistling a song in the BBC children's television series <i>In the Night Garden...</i>.\n</p><p>Harrison Tordoff, a World War II fighter ace and later a noted ornithologist, named his P-51 Mustang as <i>Upupa epops</i>, the scientific name of the hoopoe bird. </p>\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n\n<h2><span id=\"External_links\">External links</span></h2>\n<ul><li>Hoopoe- Species text in The Atlas of Southern African Birds.</li>\n<li>Ageing and sexing (PDF; 5.3 MB) by Javier Blasco-Zumeta &amp; Gerd-Michael Heinze</li>\n<li>Hoopoe videos, photos &amp; sounds on the Internet Bird Collection</li>\n<li>\u00a0<cite class=\"citation encyclopaedia\"><span title=\"s:Collier's New Encyclopedia (1921)/Hoop\u0153\">\"Hoop\u0153\"\u00a0</span>. <i>Collier's New Encyclopedia</i>. 1921.</cite><span title=\"ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Abook&amp;rft.genre=bookitem&amp;rft.atitle=Hoop%C5%93&amp;rft.btitle=Collier%27s+New+Encyclopedia&amp;rft.date=1921&amp;rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fen.wikipedia.org%3AHoopoe\"></span><link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r951705291\"></li>\n<li>\u00a0<cite class=\"citation encyclopaedia\"><span title=\"s:The Encyclopedia Americana (1920)/Hoopoe\">\"Hoopoe\"\u00a0</span>. <i>Encyclopedia Americana</i>. 1920.</cite><span title=\"ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Abook&amp;rft.genre=bookitem&amp;rft.atitle=Hoopoe&amp;rft.btitle=Encyclopedia+Americana&amp;rft.date=1920&amp;rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fen.wikipedia.org%3AHoopoe\"></span><link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r951705291\"></li></ul>"

A species found in scrub and forest, it is easily detected from its loud whistles and the bright colours. During the breeding season, males display by fluffing up their feathers and spiral in the air appearing like a green, black, yellow and white ball.\n</p>\n\n\n<h2><span id=\"Description\">Description</span></h2>\n<p>Ioras have a pointed and notched beak with a culmen that is straight. The common iora is sexually dimorphic, males in the breeding season have a black cap and back adding to a black wing and tail at all seasons. Females have greenish wings and an olive tail. The undersides of both are yellow and the two white bars on the wings of the male are particularly prominent in their breeding plumage. The males in breeding plumage have a very variable distribution of the black on the upperparts and can be confused with Marshall's iora, however, the latter always has white tips to the tail. The nominate subspecies is found along the Himalayas and males of this population are very similar to females or have only a small amount of black on the crown. In northwestern India, <i>septentrionalis</i> is brighter yellow than others and in the northern plains of India <i>humei</i> males in breeding plumage have a black cap and olive on the upper mantle. In southwestern India and Sri Lanka <i>multicolor</i> has the breeding males with a jet black cap and mantle. The forms in the rest of southern India are intermediate between <i>multicolor</i> and <i>humei</i> with more grey-green on the rump (formerly considered as <i>deignani</i> but now used for the Burmese population).</p><p>Several other populations across Southeast Asia are designated as subspecies including <i>philipi</i> of southern China and northern Thailand/Laos, <i>deignani</i> of Myanmar, <i>horizoptera</i> of southern Myanmar and the island chain of Sumatra, <i>cambodiana</i> of Cambodia, <i>aeqanimis</i> of Palawan and northern Borneo, <i>viridis</i> of Borneo and <i>scapularis</i> of Java and Bali.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Behaviour_and_ecology\">Behaviour and ecology</span></h2>\n<p>Ioras forage in trees in small groups, gleaning among the branches for insects. They sometimes join mixed species feeding flocks. The call is a mixture of <i>churrs</i>, chattering and whistles, and the song is a trilled <i>wheeeee-tee</i>. They may sometimes imitate the calls of other birds such as drongos.</p>\n\n<p>During the breeding season, mainly after the monsoons, the male performs an acrobatic courtship display, darting up into the air fluffing up all his feathers, especially those on the pale green rump, then spiralling down to the original perch. Once he lands, he spreads his tail and droops his wings. Two to four greenish white eggs are laid in a small and compact cup-shaped nest made out of grass and bound with cobwebs and placed in the fork of a tree. Both male and female incubate and eggs hatch after about 14 days. Nests predators include snakes, lizards, crow-pheasant and crows. Nests may also be brood-parasitized by the banded bay cuckoo.</p><p>Ioras moult twice in a year and the plumage variation makes them somewhat complicated for plumage based separation of the populations.</p><p>A species of <i>Haemoproteus</i>, <i>H. aethiginae</i>, was described from a specimen of the common iora from Goa.</p>\n<ul class=\"gallery mw-gallery-traditional\" style=\"max-width: 978px;\"><li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\">\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\">\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\">\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\">\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\">\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\">\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\">\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\">\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\">\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\">\n</ul><ul class=\"gallery mw-gallery-traditional\" style=\"max-width: 892px;\"><li class=\"gallerycaption\">Museum specimens for subspecies at Naturalis</li>\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 215px\">\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 215px\">\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 215px\">\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 215px\">\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 215px\">\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 215px\">\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 215px\">\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 215px\">\n</ul><h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n\n<h2><span id=\"External_links\">External links</span></h2>\n<ul><li>BirdLife Species Factsheet</li>\n<li>Common Iora videos, photos &amp; sounds on the Internet Bird Collection</li></ul>"

        "details": "<p>The <b>common kestrel</b> (<i>Falco tinnunculus</i>) is a bird of prey species belonging to the kestrel group of the falcon family Falconidae. It is also known as the <b>European kestrel</b>, <b>Eurasian kestrel</b>, or <b>Old World kestrel</b>. In Britain, where no other kestrel species occurs, it is generally just called \"the <b>kestrel</b>\".</p><p>This species occurs over a large range. It is widespread in Europe, Asia, and Africa, as well as occasionally reaching the east coast of North America. It has colonized a few oceanic islands, but vagrant individuals are generally rare; in the whole of Micronesia for example, the species was only recorded twice each on Guam and Saipan in the Marianas.</p>\n\n\n<h2><span id=\"Description\">Description</span></h2>\n<p>Common kestrels measure 32\u201339\u00a0cm (13\u201315\u00a0in) from head to tail, with a wingspan of 65\u201382\u00a0cm (26\u201332\u00a0in). Females are noticeably larger, with the adult male weighing 136\u2013252\u00a0g (4.8\u20138.9\u00a0oz), around 155\u00a0g (5.5\u00a0oz) on average; the adult female weighs 154\u2013314\u00a0g (5.4\u201311.1\u00a0oz), around 184\u00a0g (6.5\u00a0oz) on average. They are thus small compared with other birds of prey, but larger than most songbirds. Like the other <i>Falco</i> species, they have long wings as well as a distinctive long tail.</p><p>Their plumage is mainly light chestnut brown with blackish spots on the upperside and buff with narrow blackish streaks on the underside; the remiges are also blackish. Unlike most raptors, they display sexual colour dimorphism with the male having fewer black spots and streaks, as well as a blue-grey cap and tail. The tail is brown with black bars in females, and has a black tip with a narrow white rim in both sexes. All common kestrels have a prominent black malar stripe like their closest relatives.</p><p>The cere, feet, and a narrow ring around the eye are bright yellow; the toenails, bill and iris are dark. Juveniles look like adult females, but the underside streaks are wider; the yellow of their bare parts is paler. Hatchlings are covered in white down feathers, changing to a buff-grey second down coat before they grow their first true plumage.</p>\n\n<ul class=\"gallery mw-gallery-traditional\"><li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\">\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\">\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\">\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\">\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\">\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\">\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\">\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\">\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\">\n</ul><h2><span id=\"Behaviour_and_ecology\">Behaviour and ecology</span></h2>\n<p>In the cool-temperate parts of its range, the common kestrel migrates south in winter; otherwise it is sedentary, though juveniles may wander around in search for a good place to settle down as they become mature. It is a diurnal animal of the lowlands and prefers open habitat such as fields, heaths, shrubland and marshland. It does not require woodland to be present as long as there are alternative perching and nesting sites like rocks or buildings. It will thrive in treeless steppe where there are abundant herbaceous plants and shrubs to support a population of prey animals. The common kestrel readily adapts to human settlement, as long as sufficient swathes of vegetation are available, and may even be found in wetlands, moorlands and arid savanna. It is found from the sea to the lower mountain ranges, reaching up to 4,500\u00a0m (14,800\u00a0ft) ASL in the hottest tropical parts of its range but only to about 1,750\u00a0m (5,740\u00a0ft) in the subtropical climate of the Himalayan foothills.</p><p>Globally, this species is not considered threatened by the IUCN. Its stocks were affected by the indiscriminate use of organochlorines and other pesticides in the mid-20th century, but being something of an r-strategist able to multiply quickly under good conditions it was less affected than other birds of prey. The global population has been fluctuating considerably over the years but remains generally stable; it is roughly estimated at 1\u20132 million pairs or so, about 20% of which are found in Europe. There has been a recent decline in parts of Western Europe such as Ireland. Subspecies <i>dacotiae</i> is quite rare, numbering less than 1000 adult birds in 1990, when the ancient western Canarian subspecies <i>canariensis</i> numbered about ten times as many birds.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Food_and_feeding\">Food and feeding</span></h3>\n\n\n<p>When hunting, the common kestrel characteristically hovers about 10\u201320\u00a0m (33\u201366\u00a0ft) above the ground, searching for prey, either by flying into the wind or by soaring using ridge lift. Like most birds of prey, common kestrels have keen eyesight enabling them to spot small prey from a distance. Once prey is sighted, the bird makes a short, steep dive toward the target. It can often be found hunting along the sides of roads and motorways. This species is able to see near ultraviolet light, allowing the birds to detect the urine trails around rodent burrows as they shine in an ultraviolet colour in the sunlight. Another favourite (but less conspicuous) hunting technique is to perch a bit above the ground cover, surveying the area. When the birds spots prey animals moving by, they will pounce on them. They also prowl a patch of hunting ground in a ground-hugging flight, ambushing prey as they happen across it.</p>\n\n\n<p>Common kestrels eat almost exclusively mouse-sized mammals. Voles, shrews and true mice supply up to three-quarters or more of the biomass most individuals ingest. On oceanic islands (where mammals are often scarce), small birds (mainly passerines) may make up the bulk of its diet. Elsewhere, birds are only an important food during a few weeks each summer when inexperienced fledglings abound. Other suitably sized vertebrates like bats, swifts, frogs and lizards are eaten only on rare occasions. However, kestrels are more likely to prey on lizards in southern latitudes. In northern latitudes, the kestrel is found more often to deliver lizards to their nestlings during midday and also with increasing ambient temperature. Seasonally, arthropods may be a main prey item. Generally, invertebrates like camel spiders and even earthworms, but mainly sizeable insects such as beetles, orthopterans and winged termites will be eaten.</p><p><i>F. tinnunculus</i> requires the equivalent of 4\u20138 voles a day, depending on energy expenditure (time of the year, amount of hovering, etc.). They have been known to catch several voles in succession and cache some for later consumption. An individual nestling consumes on average 4.2 g/h, equivalent to 67.8 g/d (3\u20134 voles per day).</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Reproduction\">Reproduction</span></h3>\n<p>The common kestrel starts breeding in spring (or the start of the dry season in the tropics), i.e. April or May in temperate Eurasia and some time between August and December in the tropics and southern Africa. It is a cavity nester, preferring holes in cliffs, trees or buildings; in built-up areas, common kestrels will often nest on buildings, and will reuse the old nests of corvids. The diminutive subspecies <i>dacotiae</i>, the <i>sarnicolo</i> of the eastern Canary Islands is peculiar for nesting occasionally in the dried fronds below the top of palm trees, apparently coexisting with small songbirds which also make their home there. In general, common kestrels will usually tolerate conspecifics nesting nearby, and sometimes a few dozen pairs may be found nesting in a loose colony.</p>\n\n<p>The clutch is normally 3\u20137 eggs; more eggs may be laid in total but some will be removed during the laying time. This lasts about 2 days per egg laid. The eggs are abundantly patterned with brown spots, from a wash that tinges the entire surface buffish white to large almost-black blotches. Incubation lasts from 4 weeks to one month, and only the female incubates the eggs. The male is responsible for providing her with food, and for some time after hatching this remains the same. Later, both parents share brooding and hunting duties until the young fledge, after 4\u20135 weeks. The family stays close together for a few weeks, during which time the young learn how to fend for themselves and hunt prey. The young become sexually mature the next breeding season. Female kestrel chicks with blacker plumage have been found to have bolder personalities, indicating that even in juvenile birds plumage coloration can act as a status signal. </p><p>Data from Britain shows nesting pairs bringing up about 2\u20133 chicks on average, though this includes a considerable rate of total brood failures; actually, few pairs that do manage to fledge offspring raise less than 3 or 4. Compared to their siblings, first-hatched chicks have greater survival and recruitment probability, thought to be due to the first-hatched chicks obtaining a higher body condition when in the nest. Population cycles of prey, particularly voles, have a considerable influence on breeding success. Most common kestrels die before they reach 2 years of age; mortality up until the first birthday may be as high as 70%. At least females generally breed at one year of age; possibly, some males take a year longer to maturity as they do in related species.

The common kestrel's closest living relative is apparently the nankeen or Australian kestrel (<i>F. cenchroides</i>), which probably derived from ancestral common kestrels settling in Australia and adapting to local conditions less than one million years ago, during the Middle Pleistocene.</p><p>The rock kestrel (<i>F. rupicolus</i>), previously considered a subspecies, is now treated as a distinct species.\n</p><p>The lesser kestrel (<i>F. naumanni</i>), which much resembles a small common kestrel with no black on the upperside except wing and tail tips, is probably not very closely related to the present species, and the American kestrel (<i>F. sparverius</i>) is apparently not a true kestrel at all. Both species have much grey in their wings in males, which does not occur in the common kestrel or its close living relatives but does in almost all other falcons.\n</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Subspecies\">Subspecies</span></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A number of subspecies of the common kestrel are known, though some are hardly distinct and may be invalid. Most of them differ little, and mainly in accordance with Bergmann's and Gloger's Rules.

The remains of these birds, which presumably were the direct ancestors of the living <i>F. t. tinnunculus</i> (and perhaps other subspecies), are found throughout the then-unglaciated parts of Europe, from the Late Pliocene (ELMA Villanyian/ICS Piacenzian, MN16) about 3 million years ago to the Middle Pleistocene Saalian glaciation which ended about 130,000 years ago, when they finally gave way to birds indistinguishable from those living today. Some of the voles the Ice Age common kestrels ate\u2014such as European pine voles (<i>Microtus subterraneus</i>)\u2014were indistinguishable from those alive today. Other prey species of that time evolved more rapidly (like <i>M. malei</i>, the presumed ancestor of today's tundra vole <i>M. oeconomus</i>), while yet again others seem to have gone entirely extinct without leaving any living descendants\u2014for example <i>Pliomys lenki</i>, which apparently fell victim to the Weichselian glaciation about 100,000 years ago.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"In_culture\">In culture</span></h2>\n<p>The kestrel is sometimes seen, like other birds of prey, as a symbol of the power and vitality of nature. In \"Into Battle\" (1915), the war poet Julian Grenfell invokes the superhuman characteristics of the kestrel among several birds, when hoping for prowess in battle:\n</p>\n<blockquote><p>\"The kestrel hovering by day,<br></p><p>And the little owl that call at night,<br>\nBid him be swift and keen as they,<br></p><p>\nAs keen of ear, as swift of sight.\"</p></blockquote>\n<p>Gerard Manley Hopkins (1844\u20131889) writes on the kestrel in his poem \"The Windhover\", exalting in their mastery of flight and their majesty in the sky.\n</p>\n<blockquote><p>\"I caught this morning morning's minion, king-<br>\ndom of daylight's dauphin, dapple-dawn-drawn Falcon, in his riding\"</p></blockquote>\n<p>A kestrel is also one of the main characters in <i>The Animals of Farthing Wood</i>.\n</p><p>Barry Hines\u2019 novel <i>A Kestrel for a Knave</i> - together with the 1969 film based on it, Ken Loach's <i>Kes</i> - is about a working-class boy in England who befriends a kestrel.\n</p><p>The Pathan name for the kestrel, B\u0101d Khurak, means \"wind hover\" and in Punjab it is called Larz\u0101nak or \"little hoverer\". It was once used as a decoy to capture other birds of prey in Persia and Arabia. It was also used to train greyhounds meant for hunting gazelles in parts of Arabia. Young greyhounds would be set after jerboa-rats which would also be distracted and forced to make twists and turns by the dives of a kestrel.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Etymology\">Etymology</span></h3>\n<p>The name \"kestrel\" is derived from the French cr\u00e9cerelle which is diminutive for cr\u00e9celle, which also referred to a bell used by lepers. The word first appears in 1678 in the work of Francis Willughby. The kestrel was once used to drive and keep away pigeons. Archaic names for the kestrel include <i>windhover</i> and <i>windfucker,</i> due to its habit of beating the wind (hovering in air).</p><p>The Late Latin <i>falco</i> derives from <i>falx</i>, <i>falcis</i>, a sickle, referencing the claws of the bird. The species name <i>tinnunculus</i> is Latin for \"kestrel\" from \"tinnulus\", \"shrill\".</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Footnotes\">Footnotes</span></h2>\n\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n<ul><li><cite id=\"CITEREF\u00c1lamo_Tav\u00edo1975\" class=\"citation journal\">\u00c1lamo Tav\u00edo, Manuel (1975).

It is resident in much of its range, but migrates from areas where rivers freeze in winter.\n</p><p>This sparrow-sized bird has the typical short-tailed, large-headed kingfisher profile; it has blue upperparts, orange underparts and a long bill. It feeds mainly on fish, caught by diving, and has special visual adaptations to enable it to see prey under water. The glossy white eggs are laid in a nest at the end of a burrow in a riverbank.\n</p>\n\n\n<h2><span id=\"Taxonomy\">Taxonomy</span></h2>\n<p>The common kingfisher was first described by Carl Linnaeus in the 10th edition of his <i>Systema Naturae</i> in 1758 as <i>Gracula atthis</i>. The modern binomial name derives from the Latin <i><i lang=\"la\" title=\"Latin language text\">alcedo</i></i>, 'kingfisher' (from Greek <span lang=\"el\" title=\"Greek language text\">\u1f00\u03bb\u03ba\u03c5\u03ce\u03bd</span>, <i><i lang=\"el\" title=\"Greek language text\">halcyon</i></i>), and <i>Atthis</i>, a beautiful young woman of Lesbos, and favourite of Sappho.</p><p>The genus <i>Alcedo</i> comprises seven small kingfishers that all eat fish as part of their diet. The common kingfisher's closest relative is the cerulean kingfisher that has white underparts and is found in parts of Indonesia.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Description\">Description</span></h2>\n<p>This species has the typical short-tailed, dumpy-bodied, large-headed, and long-billed kingfisher shape. The adult male of the western European subspecies, <i>A. a. ispida</i> has green-blue upperparts with pale azure-blue back and rump, a rufous patch by the bill base, and a rufous ear-patch. It has a green-blue neck stripe, white neck blaze and throat, rufous underparts, and a black bill with some red at the base. The legs and feet are bright red. It is about 16 centimetres (6.3\u00a0in) long with a wingspan of 25\u00a0cm (9.8\u00a0in), and weighs 34\u201346 grams (1.2\u20131.6\u00a0oz). The female is identical in appearance to the male except that her lower mandible is orange-red with a black tip. The juvenile is similar to the adult, but with duller and greener upperparts and paler underparts. Its bill is black, and the legs are also initially black. Feathers are moulted gradually between July and November with the main flight feathers taking 90\u2013100 days to moult and regrow. Some that moult late may suspend their moult during cold winter weather.   \n</p><p>The flight of the kingfisher is fast, direct and usually low over water. The short, rounded wings whirr rapidly, and a bird flying away shows an electric-blue \"flash\" down its back.</p><p>In North Africa, Europe and Asia north of the Himalayas, this is the only small blue kingfisher. In south and southeast Asia, it can be confused with six other small blue-and-rufous kingfishers, but the rufous ear patches distinguish it from all but juvenile blue-eared kingfishers; details of the head pattern may be necessary to differentiate the two species where both occur.</p><p>The common kingfisher has no song. The flight call is a short, sharp whistle <i>chee</i> repeated two or three times. Anxious birds emit a harsh, <i>shrit-it-it</i> and nestlings call for food with a churring noise.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Geographical_variation\">Geographical variation</span></h3>\n<p>There are seven subspecies differing in the hue of the upperparts and the intensity of the rufous colour of the underparts; size varies across the subspecies by up to 10%. The races resident south of the Wallace Line have the bluest upperparts and partly blue ear-patches.</p>\n<ul><li><i>A. a. ispida</i> (Linnaeus, 1758). Breeds from Ireland, Spain and southern Norway to Romania and western Russia and winters south to Iraq and southern Portugal.</li>\n<li><i>A. a. atthis</i> Linnaeus, 1758. Breeds from northwestern Africa and southern Italy east to Afghanistan, Kashmir region, northern Xinjiang, and Siberia; it is a winter visitor south to Israel, northeastern Sudan, Yemen, Oman and Pakistan. Compared to <i>A. a. ispida</i>, it has a greener crown, paler underparts and is slightly larger.</li>\n<li><i>A. a. bengalensis</i> Gmelin, 1788. Breeds in southern and eastern Asia from India to Indonesia, China, Korea, Japan and eastern Mongolia; winters south to Indonesia and the Philippines. It is smaller and brighter than the European races.</li>\n<li><i>A. a. taprobana</i> Kleinschmidt, 1894. Resident breeder in Sri Lanka and southern India. Its upperparts are bright blue, not green-blue; it is the same size as <i>A. a. bengalensis</i>.</li>\n<li><i>A. a. floresiana</i> Sharpe, 1892. Resident breeder from Bali to Timor. Like <i>A. a. taprobana</i>, but the blues are darker and the ear-patch is rufous with a few blue feathers.</li>\n<li><i>A. a. hispidoides</i> Lesson, 1837. Resident breeder from Sulawesi to New Guinea and the islands of the western Pacific Ocean. Plumage colours are deeper than in <i>A. a. floresiana</i>, the blue on the hind neck and rump is purple-tinged and the ear-patch is blue.</li>\n<li><i>A. a. solomonensis</i> Rothschild and Hartert, 1905. Resident breeder in the Solomon Islands east to San Cristobal. The largest southeast Asian subspecies, it has a blue ear-patch and is more purple-tinged than <i>A. a. hispidoides</i>, with which it interbreeds.</li></ul><h2><span id=\"Habitat_and_distribution\">Habitat and distribution</span></h2>\n<p>The common kingfisher is widely distributed over Europe, Asia, and North Africa, mainly south of 60\u00b0N. It is a common breeding species over much of its vast Eurasian range, but in North Africa it is mainly a winter visitor, although it is a scarce breeding resident in coastal Morocco and Tunisia. In temperate regions, this kingfisher inhabits clear, slow-flowing streams and rivers, and lakes with well-vegetated banks. It frequents scrubs and bushes with overhanging branches close to shallow open water in which it hunts. In winter it is more coastal, often feeding in estuaries or harbours and along rocky seashores. Tropical populations are found by slow-flowing rivers, in mangrove creeks and in swamps.</p><p>Common kingfishers are important members of ecosystems and good indicators of freshwater community health. The highest densities of breeding birds are found in habitats with clear water, which permits optimal prey visibility, and trees or shrubs on the banks. These habitats have also the highest quality of water, so the presence of this bird confirms the standard of the water. Measures to improve water flow can disrupt this habitat, and in particular, the replacement of natural banks by artificial confinement greatly reduces the populations of fish, amphibians and aquatic reptiles, and waterside birds are lost. It can tolerate a certain degree of urbanisation, provided the water remains clean.\n</p><p>This species is resident in areas where the climate is mild year-round, but must migrate after breeding from regions with prolonged freezing conditions in winter. Most birds winter within the southern parts of the breeding range, but smaller numbers cross the Mediterranean into Africa or travel over the mountains of Malaysia into Southeast Asia. Kingfishers migrate mainly at night, and some Siberian breeders must travel at least 3,000\u00a0km (1,900\u00a0mi) between the breeding sites and the wintering areas.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Behaviour\">Behaviour</span></h2>\n<h3><span id=\"Breeding\">Breeding</span></h3>\n\n\n<p>Like all kingfishers, the common kingfisher is highly territorial; since it must eat around 60% of its body weight each day, it is essential to have control of a suitable stretch of river. It is solitary for most of the year, roosting alone in heavy cover. If another kingfisher enters its territory, both birds display from perches, and fights may occur, in which a bird will grab the other's beak and try to hold it underwater. Pairs form in the autumn but each bird retains a separate territory, generally at least 1\u00a0km (0.62\u00a0mi) long, but up to 3.5\u00a0km (2.2\u00a0mi) and territories are not merged until the spring.</p><p>The courtship is initiated by the male chasing the female while calling continually, and later by ritual feeding, with copulation usually following.</p><p>The nest is in a burrow excavated by both birds of the pair in a low vertical riverbank, or sometimes a quarry or other cutting. The straight, gently inclining burrow is normally 60\u201390\u00a0cm (24\u201335\u00a0in) long and ends in an enlarged chamber. The nest cavity is unlined but soon accumulates a litter of fish remains and cast pellets.</p><p>The common kingfisher typically lays two to ten glossy white eggs, which average 1.9\u00a0cm (0.75\u00a0in) in breadth, 2.2\u00a0cm (0.87\u00a0in) in length, and weigh about 4.3\u00a0g (0.15\u00a0oz), of which 5% is shell. One or two eggs in most clutches fail to hatch because the parent cannot cover them. Both sexes incubate by day, but only the female incubates at night. An incubating bird sits trance-like, facing the tunnel; it invariably casts a pellet, breaking it up with the bill. The eggs hatch in 19\u201320 days, and the altricial young are in the nest for a further 24\u201325 days, often more. Once large enough, young birds will come to the burrow entrance to be fed. Two broods, sometimes three, may be reared in a season.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Survival\">Survival</span></h3>\n<p>The early days for fledged juveniles are more hazardous; during its first dives into the water, about four days after leaving the nest, a fledgling may become waterlogged and drown. Many young will not have learned to fish by the time they are driven out of their parents' territory, and only about half survive more than a week or two. Most kingfishers die of cold or lack of food, and a severe winter can kill a high percentage of the birds. Summer floods can destroy nests or make fishing difficult, resulting in starvation of the brood. Only a quarter of the young survive to breed the following year, but this is enough to maintain the population. Likewise, only a quarter of adult birds survive from one breeding season to the next. Very few birds live longer than one breeding season. The oldest bird on record was 21 years.</p><p>Other causes of death are cats, rats, collisions with vehicles and windows, and human disturbance of nesting birds, including riverbank works with heavy machinery. Since kingfishers are high up in the food chain, they are vulnerable to build-up of chemicals, and river pollution by industrial and agricultural products excludes the birds from many stretches of otherwise suitable rivers that would be habitats.</p><p>This species was killed in Victorian times for stuffing and display in glass cases and use in hat making. English naturalist William Yarrell also reported the country practice of killing a kingfisher and hanging it from a thread in the belief that it would swing to predict the direction in which the wind would blow. Persecution by anglers and to provide feathers for fishing flies were common in earlier decades, but are now largely a thing of the past.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Feeding\">Feeding</span></h3>\n\n<p>The common kingfisher hunts from a perch 1\u20132\u00a0m (3.3\u20136.6\u00a0ft) above the water, on a branch, post or riverbank, bill pointing down as it searches for prey. It bobs its head when food is detected to gauge the distance and plunges steeply down to seize its prey usually no deeper than 25\u00a0cm (9.8\u00a0in) below the surface. The wings are opened underwater and the open eyes are protected by the transparent third eyelid. The bird rises beak-first from the surface and flies back to its perch. At the perch the fish is adjusted until it is held near its tail and beaten against the perch several times. Once dead, the fish is positioned lengthways and swallowed head-first. A few times each day, a small greyish pellet of fish bones and other indigestible remains is regurgitated.</p><p>The food is mainly fish up to 12.5\u00a0cm (4.9\u00a0in) long, but the average size is 2.3\u00a0cm (0.91\u00a0in). In Central Europe, 97% of the diet was found to be composed of fish ranging in size from 2 to 10\u00a0cm with an average of 6.5\u00a0cm (body mass range from &lt;0.1 g to &gt;10 g, average 3 g). Minnows, sticklebacks, small roach and trout are typical prey. About 60% of food items are fish, but this kingfisher also catches aquatic insects such as dragonfly larvae and water beetles, and, in winter, crustaceans including freshwater shrimps. In Central Europe, however, fish represented 99.9% of the diet (data from rivers, streams, and reservoirs from years 1999 to 2013). Common kingfishers have also been observed to catch lamprey. One study found that food provisioning rate increased with brood size, from 1498 g (505 fishes for four nestlings) to 2968 g (894 fishes for eight nestlings). During the fledging period each chick consumed on average 334 g of fish, which resulted in an estimated daily food intake of 37% of the chick's body mass (average over the entire nestling period). The average daily energy intake was 73.5 kJ per chick (i.e., 1837 kJ per 25 days of the fledging period).</p><p>A challenge for any diving bird is the change in refraction between air and water. The eyes of many birds have two foveae (the fovea is the area of the retina with the greatest density of light receptors), and a kingfisher can switch from the main central fovea to the auxiliary fovea when it enters water; a retinal streak of high receptor density which connects the two foveae allows the image to swing temporally as the bird drops onto the prey. The egg-shaped lens of the eye points towards the auxiliary fovea, enabling the bird to maintain visual acuity underwater. Because of the positions of the foveae, the kingfisher has monocular vision in air, and binocular vision in water. The underwater vision is not as a sharp as in air, but the ability to judge the distance of moving prey is more important than the sharpness of the image.</p><p>Each cone cell of a bird's retina contains an oil droplet that may contain carotenoid pigments. These droplets enhance color vision and reduce glare. Aquatic kingfishers have high numbers of red pigments in their oil droplets; the reason red droplets predominate is not understood, but the droplets may help with the glare or the dispersion of light from particulate matter in the water.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Status\">Status</span></h2>\n<p>This species has a large range, with an estimated global extent of occurrence of 10\u00a0million square kilometres (3.8\u00a0million square miles). It has a large population, including an estimated 160,000\u2013320,000 individuals in Europe alone. Global population trends have not been quantified, but populations appear to be stable so the species is not believed to approach the thresholds for the population decline criterion of the IUCN Red List (i.e., declining more than 30% in ten years or three generations). For these reasons, the species is evaluated as \"least concern\".</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Gallery\">Gallery</span></h2>\n<ul class=\"gallery mw-gallery-packed\"><li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 122px\">\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 137.33333333333px\">\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 182px\">\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 215.33333333333px\">\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 162px\">\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 181.33333333333px\">\n</ul><h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n\n<h2><span id=\"Further_reading\">Further reading</span></h2>\n<ul><li><cite id=\"CITEREFCramp1985\" class=\"citation book\">Cramp, Stanley, ed.

The species was formerly placed in the genus <i>Carduelis</i> but based on the results of a phylogenetic analysis of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences published in 2012, it was moved to the genus <i>Linaria</i> that had been introduced by the German naturalist Johann Matth\u00e4us Bechstein in 1802.</p><p>The genus name <i>linaria</i> is the Latin for a linen-weaver, from <i>linum</i>, \"flax\". The species name <i>cannabina</i> comes from the Latin for hemp. The English name has a similar root, being derived from Old French <i>linette</i>, from <i>lin</i>, \"flax\".</p><p>There are seven recognised subspecies:</p>\n<ul><li><i>L. c. autochthona</i> (Clancey, 1946) \u2013 Scotland</li>\n<li><i>L. c. cannabina</i> (Linnaeus, 1758) \u2013 western, central and northern Europe, western and central Siberia.

The upper parts are brown, the throat is sullied white and the bill is grey. The summer male has a grey nape, red head-patch and red breast. Females and young birds lack the red and have white underparts, the breast streaked buff.\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Distribution\">Distribution</span></h2>\n<p>The common linnet breeds in Europe, the western Palearctic and north Africa. It is partially resident, but many eastern and northern birds migrate farther south in the breeding range or move to the coasts. They are sometimes found several hundred miles off-shore.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Behaviour\">Behaviour</span></h2>\n\n<p>Open land with thick bushes is favoured for breeding, including heathland and garden. It builds its nest in a bush, laying four to seven eggs.\n</p><p>This species can form large flocks outside the breeding season, sometimes mixed with other finches, such as twite, on coasts and salt marshes.\n</p><p>The common linnet's pleasant song contains fast trills and twitters.\n</p><p>It feeds on the ground, and low down in bushes, its food mainly consisting of seeds, which it also feeds to its chicks. It likes small to medium-sized seeds from most arable weeds, knotgrass, dock), crucifers (including charlock, shepherd's purse), chickweeds, dandelions, thistle, sow-thistle, mayweed, common groundsel, common hawthorn and birch. They have a small component of Invertebrates in their diet.\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Conservation\">Conservation</span></h2>\n<p>The common linnet is listed by the UK Biodiversity Action Plan as a priority species. It is protected in the UK by the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981.\n</p><p>In Britain, populations are declining, attributed to increasing use of herbicides, aggressive scrub removal and excessive hedge trimming; its population fell by 56% between 1968 and 1991, probably due to a decrease in seed supply and the increasing use of herbicide. From 1980\u20132009, according to the Pan-European Common Bird Monitoring Scheme, the European population decreased by 62%</p><p>Favourable management practices on agricultural land include:\n</p>\n<ul><li>Set-aside</li>\n<li>Overwinter stubbles</li>\n<li>Uncultivated margins, ditches, field corners</li>\n<li>Conservation headlands</li>\n<li>Wild bird cover, using plants that produce small, oil-rich seeds, such as kale, quinoa, mustard plant and oil-seed rape <i>Brassica napus</i></li>\n<li>Restoration of meadows: restoration and creation of hay-meadows</li>\n<li>Short, thick, thorny hedgerows and scrub for nesting habitat</li></ul><p>Robert Burns's 1788 poem \"A Mother's Lament for the Death of Her Son\" also tells of a linnet bird bewailing her ravished young.\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Cultural_references\">Cultural references</span></h2>\n<p>The bird was a popular pet in the late Victorian and Edwardian eras. Alfred, Lord Tennyson mentions \"the linnet born within the cage\" in Canto 27 of his 1849 poem \"In Memoriam A.H.H.\", the same section that contains the famous lines \"'Tis better to have loved and lost / Than never to have loved at all.\" A \"cock linnet\" features in the classic British music hall song of that period My Old Man, and as a character in Oscar Wilde's children's story \"The Devoted Friend\"; Wilde also mentions how the call of the linnet awakens \"The Selfish Giant\" to the one tree where it is springtime in his garden. William Butler Yeats evokes the image of the common linnet in <i>The Lake Isle of Innisfree</i> (1890) in line 8: \"And evening full of the linnet's wings.\" In the novel <i>The Old Curiosity Shop</i> by Charles Dickens, the heroine Nell keeps \"only a poor linnet\" in a cage, which she leaves for Kit as a sign of her gratefulness to him.\n</p><p>The English Baroque composer John Blow composed an ode on the occasion of the death of his colleague Henry Purcell, \"An Ode on the Death of Mr. Purcell\" set to the poem \"Mark how the lark and linnet sing\" by the poet John Dryden.\n</p><p>\"The Linnets\" has become the nickname of King's Lynn Football Club, Burscough Football Club and Runcorn Linnets Football Club (formerly known as 'Runcorn F.C.' and Runcorn F.C. Halton). Barry Town F.C., the South Wales-based football team, also used to be nicknamed 'The Linnets'.\n</p><p>William Blake invokes \"the linnet's song\" in one of the poems entitled \"Song\" in his <i>Poetical Sketches</i>.\n</p><p>Walter de la Mare's poem \"The Linnet\", published in 1918 in the collection <i>Motley and Other Poems</i>, has been set to music by a number of composers including Cecil Armstrong Gibbs, Kenneth Leighton and Jack Gibbons.</p><p>The Eurovision Song Contest 2014 entry for the Netherlands \"The Common Linnets\" is a direct reference to the bird.\n</p><p>William Wordsworth argued that the song of the common linnet provides more wisdom than books in the third verse of \"The Tables Turned\":\n</p>\n<blockquote></blockquote>\n<p>But the fellow English poet Robert Bridges used the common linnet instead to express the limitations of poetry\u2014concentrating on the difficulty in poetry of conveying the beauty of a bird's song.

It is distributed across many parts of the Old World.</p><p>The common moorhen lives around well-vegetated marshes, ponds, canals and other wetlands. The species is not found in the polar regions or many tropical rainforests. Elsewhere it is likely the most common rail species, except for the Eurasian coot in some regions.\n</p><p>The closely related common gallinule of the New World has been recognized as a separate species by most authorities, starting with the American Ornithologists' Union and the International Ornithological Committee in 2011.</p>\n\n\n<h2><span id=\"Name\">Name</span></h2>\n<p>The name <i>mor-hen</i> has been recorded in English since the 13th century. The word <i>moor</i> here is an old sense meaning <i>marsh</i>; the species is not usually found in moorland. An older name, <b>common waterhen</b>, is more descriptive of the bird's habitat.\n</p><p>A \"watercock\" is not a male \"waterhen\" but the rail species <i>Gallicrex cinerea</i>, not closely related to the common moorhen. \"Water rail\" usually refers to <i>Rallus aquaticus</i>, again not closely related.\n</p><p>The scientific name <i>Gallinula chloropus</i> comes from the Latin <i>Gallinula</i> (a small hen or chicken) and the Greek <i>chloropus</i> (<i>khloros</i> \u03c7\u03bb\u03c9\u03c1\u03cc\u03c2 green or yellow, <i>pous</i> \u03c0\u03bf\u03cd\u03c2 foot).</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Description\">Description</span></h2>\n\n<p>The moorhen is a distinctive species, with dark plumage apart from the white undertail, yellow legs and a red frontal shield. The young are browner and lack the red shield. The frontal shield of the adult has a rounded top and fairly parallel sides; the tailward margin of the red unfeathered area is a smooth waving line. In the related common gallinule of the Americas, the frontal shield has a fairly straight top and is less wide towards the bill, giving a marked indentation to the back margin of the red area.\n</p><p>The common moorhen gives a wide range of gargling calls and will emit loud hisses when threatened. A midsized to large rail, it can range from 30 to 38\u00a0cm (12 to 15\u00a0in) in length and span 50 to 62\u00a0cm (20 to 24\u00a0in) across the wings. The body mass of this species can range from 192 to 500\u00a0g (6.8 to 17.6\u00a0oz).</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Habitat\">Habitat</span></h2>\n<p>This is a common breeding bird in marsh environments,  well-vegetated lakes and even in city parks.  Populations in areas where the waters freeze, such as eastern Europe, will migrate to more temperate climates. In China, common moorhen populations are largely resident south of the Yangtze River, whilst northern populations migrate in the winter, therefore these populations show high genetic diversity. </p>\n<h2><span id=\"Behaviour\">Behaviour</span></h2>\n<h3><span id=\"Diet_and_feeding\">Diet and feeding</span></h3>\n<p>This species will consume a wide variety of vegetable material and small aquatic creatures. They forage beside or in the water, sometimes walking on lilypads or upending in the water to feed. They are often secretive, but can become tame in some areas. Despite loss of habitat in parts of its range, the common moorhen remains plentiful and widespread.\n</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Breeding\">Breeding</span></h3>\n<p>The birds are territorial during breeding season. The nest is a basket built on the ground in dense vegetation. Laying starts in spring, between mid-March and mid-May in Northern hemisphere temperate regions. About 8 eggs are usually laid per female early in the season; a brood later in the year usually has only 5\u20138 or fewer eggs. Nests may be re-used by different females. Incubation lasts about three weeks. Both parents incubate and feed the young. These fledge after 40\u201350 days, become independent usually a few weeks thereafter, and may raise their first brood the next spring. When threatened, the young may cling to the parents' body, after which the adult birds fly away to safety, carrying their offspring with them.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Status_and_population\">Status and population</span></h2>\n\n<p>On a global scale \u2013 all subspecies taken together \u2013 the common moorhen is as abundant as its vernacular name implies. It is therefore considered a species of Least Concern by the IUCN. However, small populations may be prone to extinction. The population of Palau, belonging to the widespread subspecies <i>G. c. orientalis</i> and locally known as <i>debar</i> (a generic term also used for ducks and meaning roughly \"waterfowl\"), is very rare, and apparently the birds are hunted by locals. Most of the population on the archipelago occurs on Angaur and Peleliu, while the species is probably already gone from Koror. In the Lake Ngardok wetlands of Babeldaob, a few dozen still occur, but the total number of common moorhens on Palau is about in the same region as the Guam population: fewer than 100 adult birds (usually fewer than 50) have been encountered in any survey.</p><p>The common moorhen is one of the birds (the other is the Eurasian coot, <i>Fulica atra</i>) from which the cyclocoelid flatworm parasite <i>Cyclocoelum mutabile</i> was first described. The bird is also parasitised by the moorhen flea, <i>Dasypsyllus gallinulae</i>.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Subspecies\">Subspecies</span></h2>\n<p>Five subspecies are today considered valid; several more have been described that are now considered junior synonyms. Most are not very readily recognizable, as differences are rather subtle and often clinal. Usually, the location of a sighting is the most reliable indication as to subspecies identification, but the migratory tendencies of this species make identifications based on location not completely reliable. In addition to the extant subspecies listed below, an undescribed form from the Early Pleistocene is recorded from Dursunlu in Turkey.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Gallery\">Gallery</span></h3>\n\n<ul class=\"gallery mw-gallery-traditional\"><li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\">\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\">\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\">\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\">\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\">\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\">\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\">\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\">\n</ul><h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n\n<h2><span id=\"External_links\">External links</span></h2>\n<ul><li>(Common) Moorhen species text in The Atlas of Southern African Birds</li>\n<li><cite class=\"citation web\">\"Common moorhen media\". <i>Internet Bird Collection</i>.</cite><span title=\"ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rft.genre=unknown&amp;rft.jtitle=Internet+Bird+Collection&amp;rft.atitle=Common+moorhen+media&amp;rft_id=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.hbw.com%2Fibc%2Fspecies%2Fcommon-moorhen-gallinula-chloropus&amp;rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fen.wikipedia.org%3ACommon+moorhen\"></span><link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r951705291\"></li>\n<li>Common Gallinule Species Account \u2013 Cornell Lab of Ornithology</li>\n<li>Common Moorhen Information - <i>Gallinula chloropus</i> - USGS Patuxent Bird Identification InfoCenter</li>\n<li>Madeira Birds \u2013 Moorhen breeding in Madeira Island</li>\n<li>Ageing and sexing (PDF; 5.7 MB) by Javier Blasco-Zumeta &amp; Gerd-Michael Heinze</li>\n<li>BirdLife species factsheet for <i>Gallinula chloropus</i></li>\n<li>Common moorhen photo gallery at VIREO (Drexel University)</li>\n<li>Audio recordings of Common moorhen on Xeno-canto.</li></ul>"

An omnivorous open woodland bird with a strong territorial instinct, the common myna has adapted extremely well to urban environments.\n</p><p>The range of the common myna is increasing at such a rapid rate that in 2000 the IUCN Species Survival Commission declared it one of the world's most invasive species and one of only three birds listed among \"100 of the World's Worst Invasive Species\" that pose a threat to biodiversity, agriculture and human interests. In particular, the species poses a serious threat to the ecosystems of Australia, where it was named \"The Most Important Pest/Problem\".</p>\n\n\n<h2><span id=\"Taxonomy\">Taxonomy</span></h2>\n<p>In 1760 the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson included a description of the common myna in his <i>Ornithologie</i> based on a specimen that he mistakenly believed had been collected in the Philippines. He used the French name <i>Le merle des Philippines</i> and the Latin <i>Merula Philippensis</i>. Although Brisson coined Latin names, these do not conform to the binominal system and are not recognised by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature. When in 1766 the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his <i>Systema Naturae</i> for the 12th edition, he added 240 species that had been previously described by Brisson. One of these was the common myna. Linnaeus included a brief description, coined the binominal name <i>Paradisea tristis</i> and cited Brisson's work. The type location was subsequently corrected to Pondicherry in southern India. The specific name <i>tristis</i> is Latin for \"sad\" or \"gloomy\". This species is now placed in the genus <i>Acridotheres</i> that was introduced by the French ornithologist Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot in 1816.</p><p>Two subspecies are recognised:</p>\n<ul><li>the <b>Indian myna</b> (<i>A. t. tristis</i>) (Linnaeus, 1766) \u2013 southern Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan and eastern Iran to southern China, Indochina, the Malay Peninsula and southern India</li>\n<li>the <b>Sri Lankan myna</b> (<i>A. t. melanosternus</i>) Legge, 1879 \u2013 Sri Lanka</li></ul><p>The Sri Lankan subspecies <i>melanosternus</i> is darker than the Indian subspecies <i>tristis</i> and has half-black and half-white primary coverts and a larger yellow cheek-patch.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Description\">Description</span></h2>\n<p>The common myna is readily identified by the brown body, black hooded head and the bare yellow patch behind the eye. The bill and legs are bright yellow. There is a white patch on the outer primaries and the wing lining on the underside is white. The sexes are similar and birds are usually seen in pairs.</p><p>The common myna obeys Gloger's rule in that the birds from northwestern India tend to be paler than their darker counterparts in southern India.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Vocalization\">Vocalization</span></h3>\n<p>The calls includes croaks, squawks, chirps, clicks, whistles and 'growls', and the bird often fluffs its feathers and bobs its head in singing. The common myna screeches warnings to its mate or other birds in cases of predators in proximity or when it is about to take off flying. Common mynas are popular as cage birds for their singing and \"speaking\" abilities. Before sleeping in communal roosts, common mynas vocalise in unison, which is known as \"communal noise\".</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Morphometry\">Morphometry</span></h3>\n<p>Morphometry.</p>\n<ul><li>Body length: 23 centimetres (9.1\u00a0in)</li></ul><h2><span id=\"Distribution_and_habitat\">Distribution and habitat</span></h2>\n<p>It is a species of bird native to Asia with its initial home range spanning from Iran, Pakistan, India, Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka; as well as Afghanistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Myanmar, to Malaysia, Singapore, peninsular Thailand, Indochina, Japan (both mainland Japan and the Ryukyu Islands) and China.</p><p>The common myna has been introduced in many other parts of the world such as Canada, Australia, Israel, New Zealand, New Caledonia, the United States, South Africa, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan Uzbekistan, the Cayman Islands, islands in the Indian Ocean (the Seychelles, Mauritius, R\u00e9union, Madagascar, the Maldives, the Andaman and Nicobar Islands and the Lakshadweep archipelago) and also in islands of the Atlantic (such as Ascension and Saint Helena) and the Pacific Oceans. The range of the common myna is increasing to the extent that in 2000 the IUCN Species Survival Commission declared it among the World's 100 worst invasive species.</p>\n\n<p>This abundant passerine is typically found in open woodland, cultivation and around habitation. Although this is an adaptable species, its population is abnormal and very much considered a pest in Singapore (where it is locally called as <i>gembala kerbau</i>, literally 'buffalo shepherd') due to competition with its cousin, the introduced Javan myna.</p><p>The common myna thrives in urban and suburban environments; in Canberra, for instance, 110 common mynas were released between 1968 and 1971. By 1991, common myna population density in Canberra averaged 15 birds per square kilometer. Only three years later, a second study found an average population density of 75 birds per square kilometer in the same area.</p><p>The bird likely owes its success in the urban and suburban settings of Sydney and Canberra to its evolutionary origins; having evolved in the open woodlands of India, the common myna is pre-adapted to habitats with tall vertical structures and little to no vegetative ground cover, features characteristic of city streets and urban nature preserves.\n</p><p>The common myna (along with common starlings, house sparrows, and feral rock doves) is a nuisance to city buildings; its nests block gutters and drainpipes, causing water damage to building exteriors.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Behaviour\">Behaviour</span></h2>\n\n\n\n<h3><span id=\"Breeding\">Breeding</span></h3>\n\n<p>Common mynas are believed to pair for life. They breed through much of the year depending on the location, building their nest in a hole in a tree or wall. They breed from sea-level to 3,000 m in the Himalayas.</p><p>The normal clutch size is 4\u20136 eggs. The average size of the egg is 30.8 x 21.99\u00a0mm. The incubation period is 17 to 18 days and fledging period is 22 to 24 days. The Asian koel is sometimes brood parasitic on this species. Nesting material used by common mynas includes twigs, roots, tow and rubbish. Common mynas have been known to use tissue paper, tin foil and sloughed off snake-skin.</p><p>During the breeding season, the daytime activity-time budget of the common myna in Pune in April to June 1978 has been recorded to comprise the following: nesting activity (42%), scanning the environment (28%), locomotion (12%), feeding (4%), vocalisation (7%) and preening-related activities, interactions and other activities (7%).</p><p>The common myna uses the nests of woodpeckers, parakeets, etc. and easily takes to nest boxes; it has been recorded evicting the chicks of previously nesting pairs by holding them in the beak and later sometimes not even using the emptied nest boxes. This aggressive behaviour contributes to its success as an invasive species.</p><p>There is also some evidence that shows that in introduced environments, the species chooses to nest in more modified and artificial structures than in natural tree cavities when compared to native species.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Food_and_feeding\">Food and feeding</span></h3>\n\n<p>Like most starlings, the common myna is omnivorous. It feeds on insects, arachnids, crustaceans, reptiles, small mammals, seeds, grain and fruits and discarded waste from human habitation. It forages on the ground among grass for insects, and especially for grasshoppers, from which it gets the generic name <i>Acridotheres</i>, \"grasshopper hunter\". It, however, feeds on a wide range of insects, mostly picked from the ground. It is a cross-pollinator of flowers such as <i>Salmalia</i> and <i>Erythrina</i>. It walks on the ground with occasional hops and is an opportunistic feeder on the insects disturbed by grazing cattle as well as fired grass fields.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Roosting_behaviour\">Roosting behaviour</span></h3>\n<p>Common mynas roost communally throughout the year, either in pure or mixed flocks with jungle mynas, rosy starlings, house crows, jungle crows, cattle egrets and rose-ringed parakeets and other birds.  The roost population can range from less than one hundred to thousands. The time of arrival of mynas at the roost starts before and ends just after sunset. The mynas depart before sunrise. The time and timespan of arrival and departure, time taken for final settlement at the roost, duration of communal sleep, flock size and population vary seasonally.</p><p>The function of communal roosting is to synchronise various social activities, avoid predators, exchange information about food sources.</p><p>Communal displays (pre-roosting and post-roosting) consist of aerial maneuvers which are exhibited in the pre-breeding season (November to March). It is assumed that this behaviour is related to pair formation.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Invasive_species\">Invasive species</span></h2>\n<p>The IUCN declared the common myna as one of only three birds among the world's 100 worst invasive species (the other two being the red-vented bulbul and the common starling).\nThe French introduced it in the 18th century from Pondicherry to Mauritius with the aim of controlling insects, even levying a fine on anyone persecuting the bird. It has since been introduced widely elsewhere, including adjacent areas in Southeast Asia, Madagascar, the Middle East, South Africa, Israel, the United States, Argentina, Germany, Spain and Portugal,  the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand and various oceanic islands in the Indian and Pacific Oceans, including prominent populations in Fiji and Hawaii.</p><p>The common myna is regarded as a pest in South Africa, North America, the Middle East, Australia, New Zealand and many Pacific islands.  It is particularly problematic in Australia.  Several methods have been tried to control the bird's numbers and protect native species.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Australia\">Australia</span></h3>\n\n\n<p>In Australia, the common myna is an invasive pest.  They are now often the predominant bird in urban areas all along the East Coast.  In a 2008 popular vote, the bird was named \"The Most Important Pest/Problem\" in Australia, also earning the nickname \"flying rats\" due to their scavenging resembling that of rats. It is also known as \"the cane toad of the sky\".</p><p>The common myna was first introduced to Australia in Victoria between 1863 and 1872 into Melbourne's market gardens to control insects. The bird is likely to have spread to New South Wales (where it is currently most populous) at around the same time, but documentation is uncertain. The bird was later introduced to Queensland as a predator of grasshoppers and cane beetles. Currently, common myna populations in Australia are concentrated along the eastern coast around Sydney and its surrounding suburbs, with sparser populations in Victoria and a few isolated communities in Queensland. During 2009 several municipal councils in New South Wales began trials of catching myna birds in an effort to reduce numbers.</p><p>The bird can live and breed in a wide range of temperatures, ranging from the harsh winters of Canberra to the tropical climate of Cairns. Self-sustaining populations of common myna have been found in regions of mean warmest month temperature no less than 23.2\u00a0\u00b0C and mean coldest month temperature no less than -0.4\u00a0\u00b0C, implying that the common myna could potentially spread from Sydney northward along the eastern coast to Cairns and westward along the southern coast to Adelaide (though not to Tasmania, Darwin, or the arid interior regions).</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Europe\">Europe</span></h3>\n<p>In 2019, common mynas were added to the List of Invasive Alien Species of Union concern[1]. They have established in Spain and Portugal and were introduced to France, where they occasionally bred.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"New_Zealand\">New Zealand</span></h3>\n<p>The common myna was introduced to both the North Island and South Island of New Zealand in the 1870s. However, the cooler summer temperatures in the South Island appear to have impeded the breeding success rate of the southern populations, preventing the proliferation of the species, which was largely non-existent there by the 1890s. In contrast, the North Island population was able to breed more successfully and large portions of the North Island are now populated. However, in the southern reaches of the North Island, the cooler summer temperatures, like those of the South Island, have prevented the establishment of large myna populations.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"South_Africa\">South Africa</span></h3>\n<p>In South Africa where it escaped into the wild in 1902, it has become very common and its distribution is greater where human populations are greater or where there is more human disturbance. The bird is also notorious for being a pest, kicking other birds out of their nests and killing their young due to the myna's strong territorial instinct. In South Africa it is considered somewhat of a major pest and disturbance of the natural habitat; as a result, they are frequently shot and killed or poisoned by people in urban environments and farmers alike. Bylaws in South Africa pertaining to the protection of most animal species specifically exclude mynas from this protection.</p><p>Morphological studies show that the process of spatial sorting is at work on the range expansion of <i>A. tristis</i> in South Africa. Dispersal-relevant traits are significantly correlated with distance from the range core, with strong sexual dimorphism, indicative of sex-biased dispersal. Morphological variations are significant in wing and head traits of females, suggesting females as the primary dispersing sex. In contrast, traits not related to dispersal such as those associated with foraging show no signs of spatial sorting but are significantly affected by environmental variables such as vegetation and intensity of urbanisation.\n</p>\n<h3><span id=\"The_United_States\">The United States</span></h3>\n<p>In Hawaii, it is out-competing many native birds for food and nesting areas.[2]\n</p><p>To study the invasion genetics and landscape-scale dynamics of <i>A. tristis</i>, scientists have recently developed 16 polymorphic nuclear microsatellite markers  using the next generation sequencing (NGS) approach.\n</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Effect_on_ecosystems_and_humans\">Effect on ecosystems and humans</span></h3>\n<h4><span id=\"Threat_to_native_birds\">Threat to native birds</span></h4>\n<p>The common myna is a hollow-nesting species; that is, it nests and breeds in protected hollows found either naturally in trees or artificially on buildings (for example, recessed windowsills or low eaves). Compared to native hollow-nesting species, the common myna is extremely aggressive, and breeding males will actively defend areas ranging up to 0.83 hectares in size (though males in densely populated urban settings tend to only defend the area immediately surrounding their nests).</p><p>This aggressiveness has enabled the common myna to displace many breeding pairs of native hollow-nesters, thereby reducing their reproductive success. In Australia, their aggressiveness has enabled them to chase native birds as large as galahs out of their nests.\n</p><p>The common myna is also known to maintain up to two roosts simultaneously; a temporary summer roost close to a breeding site (where the entire local male community sleeps during the summer, the period of highest aggression), and a permanent all-year roost where the female broods and incubates overnight. Both male and female common mynas will fiercely protect both roosts at all times, leading to further exclusion of native birds.</p>\n<h4><span id=\"Threat_to_crops_and_pasture\">Threat to crops and pasture</span></h4>\n<p>The common myna (which feeds mostly on ground-dwelling insects, tropical fruits such as grapes, plums and some berries and, in urban areas, discarded human food) poses a serious threat to Australian blueberry crops, though its main threat is to native bird species.</p><p>In Hawaii, where the common myna was introduced to control pest armyworms and cutworms in sugarcane crops, the bird has helped to spread the robust <i>Lantana camara</i> weed across the islands\u2019 open grasslands. It also has been recorded as the fourth-ranking avian pest in the fruit industry by a 2004 survey of the Hawaiian Farm Bureau and the sixth in number of complaints of avian pests overall.</p><p>Common mynas can cause considerable damage to ripening fruit, particularly grapes, but also figs, apples, pears, strawberries, blueberries, guava, mangoes and breadfruit. Cereal crops such as maize, wheat and rice are susceptible where they occur near urban areas. Roosting and nesting commensal with humans create aesthetic and health concerns. Common mynas are known to carry avian malaria and exotic parasites such as the <i>Ornithonyssus bursia</i> mite, which can cause dermatitis in humans. The common myna can help spread agricultural weeds: for example, it spreads the seeds of <i>Lantana camara</i>, which has been classed as a Weed of National Significance because of its invasiveness. Common mynas are regularly observed to usurp nests and hollows, destroy the eggs and kill the young of native bird species, including seabirds and parrots. There is evidence that common mynas have killed small land\nmammals such as mice, squirrels and possums, but further research on these occurrences is under consideration.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"In_culture\">In culture</span></h2>\n<p>In Sanskrit literature, the common myna has a number of names, most are descriptive of the appearance or behaviour of the bird. In addition to <i>saarika</i>, the names for the common myna include <i>kalahapriya</i>, which means \"one who is fond of arguments\" referring to the quarrelsome nature of this bird; <i>chitranetra</i>, meaning \"picturesque eyes\"; <i>peetanetra</i> (one with yellow eyes) and <i>peetapaad</i> (one with yellow legs).</p>\n\n<h2><span id=\"Gallery\">Gallery</span></h2>\n<ul class=\"gallery mw-gallery-traditional\"><li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 245px\">\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 245px\">\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 245px\">\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 245px\">\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 245px\">\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 245px\">\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 245px\">\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 245px\">\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 245px\">\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 245px\">\n</ul><h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n\n<h2><span id=\"Further_reading\">Further reading</span></h2>\n<ul><li><cite id=\"CITEREFFeareCraig,_Adrian1999\" class=\"citation book\">Feare, Chris; Craig, Adrian (1999). <i>Starlings and Mynas</i>.

The scientific name is derived from Greek <i> aithuia</i> an unidentified seabird mentioned by authors including  Hesychius and Aristotle, and Latin  <i>ferina</i>, \"wild game\", from <i>ferus</i>, \"wild\".</p>\n\n\n<h2><span id=\"Description\">Description</span></h2>\n\n<p>The adult male has a long dark bill with a grey band, a red head and neck, a black breast, red eyes and a grey back. The adult female has a brown head and body and a narrower grey bill-band. The triangular head shape is distinctive. Pochards are superficially similar to the closely related North American redhead and canvasback.\n</p><p>Females give hoarse growls. Males have whistles cut off by a final nasal note <i>aaoo-oo-haa</i>.\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Distribution_and_habitat\">Distribution and habitat</span></h2>\n<p>Their breeding habitat consists of marshes and lakes with a metre or more water depth. Pochards breed in much of temperate and northern Europe and across the Palearctic. They are migratory, and spend winter in the south and west of Europe.\n</p><p>In the British Isles, birds breed in eastern England and lowland Scotland, in small numbers in Northern Ireland with numbers increasing gradually, and sporadically in the Republic of Ireland, where it may also be increasing. While uncommon, individuals are also occasionally seen in the south of England, and small populations are sometimes observed on the River Thames. Large numbers stay overwinter in Great Britain, after the birds retreat from Russia and Scandinavia.\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Ecology\">Ecology</span></h2>\n\n<p>These are gregarious birds, forming large flocks in winter, often mixed with other diving ducks such as the tufted duck, with which they are known to hybridise.\n</p><p>These birds feed mainly by diving or dabbling. They eat aquatic plants with some molluscs, aquatic insects and small fish. They often feed at night, and will up-end for food as well as the more characteristic diving. According to the article 'Patterns in the diving behaviour of the pochard, <i>Aythya ferina</i>: a test of an optimality model' Pochard's have a behavioral preference when it comes to their feeding patterns. This behavioral preference is that Pochards prefer shallower water in comparison to deeper water even though the food concentration in deeper water may be higher.\n</p><p>In number of countries the population of Common Pochard is decreasing mainly due to urbanization of the natural habitats and their transformation, as well as due to overhunting.  \nThe pochard is one of the species to which the <i>Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds</i> (AEWA) applies.\n</p>\n\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n\n<h2><span id=\"Further_reading\">Further reading</span></h2>\n<ul><li><cite id=\"CITEREFCarboneHouston1994\" class=\"citation journal\">Carbone, C.; Houston, A.I.

It is widespread in Europe and North Africa, and is categorised by the IUCN as \"least concern\". It should not be confused with the Japanese quail, <i>Coturnix japonica</i>, native to Asia, which, although visually similar, has a very distinct call. Like the Japanese quail, common quails are sometimes kept as poultry.\n</p>\n\n\n<h2><span id=\"Description\">Description</span></h2>\n<p>It is a small, round bird, essentially streaked brown with a white eyestripe, and, in the male, a white chin. As befits its migratory nature, it has long wings, unlike the typically short-winged gamebirds. It measures roughly 18.0\u201321.9\u00a0cm (7.1\u20138.62\u00a0in) and weighs 91\u2013131\u00a0g (3.2\u20134.62\u00a0oz).</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Habits\">Habits</span></h2>\n<p>This is a terrestrial species, feeding on seeds and insects on the ground. It is notoriously difficult to see, keeping hidden in crops, and reluctant to fly, preferring to creep away instead. Even when flushed, it keeps low and soon drops back into cover. Often the only indication of its presence is the distinctive \"wet-my-lips\" repetitive song of the male. The call is uttered mostly in the mornings, evenings and sometimes at night. It is a strongly migratory bird, unlike most game birds.\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Breeding\">Breeding</span></h2>\n<p>Upon attaining an age of 6\u20138 weeks, this quail breeds on open arable farmland and grassland  the west Palearctic including most of Europe , laying 6-12 eggs in a ground nest. The eggs take from 16\u201318 days to hatch.\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Subspecies\">Subspecies</span></h2>\n<p>This species was first described by Linnaeus in his <i>Systema naturae</i> in 1758 as <i>Tetrao coturnix</i>. The Eurasian subspecies, <i>C. c. coturnix</i>, overwinters southwards in Africa's Sahel and India. The populations on Madeira and the Canary Islands belong to the nominate subspecies. The African subspecies, <i>C. c. africana</i>, described by Temminck and Schlegel in 1849, is known as the African quail. It overwinters in Africa, some moving northwards from South Africa. The common quails of Madagascar and the Comoros belong to the same African subspecies, although those found around Ethiopia make up a different subspecies, the Abyssinian quail, <i>C. c. erlangeri</i> (Zedlitz, 1912). The fairly numerous population of the Cape Verde islands belong to a separate subspecies, <i>C. c. inopinata</i>, (described by Hartert in 1917), while those on the Azores belong to subspecies <i>C. c. conturbans</i> (Hartert, 1920).\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Utilization\">Utilization</span></h2>\n<p>It is heavily hunted as game on passage through the Mediterranean area.

Found across the Northern Hemisphere, it is the most widely distributed of all corvids. There are at least eight subspecies with little variation in appearance, although recent research has demonstrated significant genetic differences among populations from various regions. It is one of the two largest corvids, alongside the thick-billed raven, and is possibly the heaviest passerine bird; at maturity, the common raven averages 63 centimetres (25 inches) in length and 1.2 kilograms (2.6 pounds) in mass. Although their typical lifespan is considerably shorter, common ravens can live more than 23 years in the wild, which among passerines only is surpassed by a few Australian species such as the satin bowerbird and probably the lyrebirds. Young birds may travel in flocks but later mate for life, with each mated pair defending a territory.\n</p><p>Common ravens have coexisted with humans for thousands of years and in some areas have been so numerous that people have regarded them as pests. Part of their success as a species is due to their omnivorous diet: they are extremely versatile and opportunistic in finding sources of nutrition, feeding on carrion, insects, cereal grains, berries, fruit, small animals, nesting birds, and food waste.\n</p><p>Some notable feats of problem-solving provide evidence that the common raven is unusually intelligent. Over the centuries, it has been the subject of mythology, folklore, art, and literature. In many cultures, including the indigenous cultures of Scandinavia, ancient Ireland and Wales, Bhutan, the northwest coast of North America, and Siberia and northeast Asia, the common raven has been revered as a spiritual figure or godlike creature.</p>\n\n\n<h2><span id=\"Taxonomy\">Taxonomy</span></h2>\n<p>The common raven was one of the many species originally described by Linnaeus in his 18th century work, <i>Systema Naturae</i>, and it still bears its original name of <i>Corvus corax</i>. It is the type species of the genus <i>Corvus</i>, derived from the Latin word for \"raven\". The specific epithet  <i>corax</i> is the Latinized form of the Greek word \u03ba\u03cc\u03c1\u03b1\u03be meaning \"raven\" or \"crow\".</p><p>The modern English word <i>raven</i> has cognates in all other Germanic languages, including Old Norse (and subsequently modern Icelandic) <i>hrafn</i> and Old High German <i>(h)raban</i>, all which descend from Proto-Germanic <i>*khrabanas</i>. An old Scottish word <i>corby</i> or <i>corbie</i>, akin to the French <i>corbeau</i>, has been used for both this bird and the carrion crow.\nObsolete collective nouns for a group of ravens (or at least the common raven) include \"unkindness\" and \"conspiracy\". In practice, most English-speakers use the more generic \"flock\".\n</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Classification\">Classification</span></h3>\n<p>The closest relatives of the common raven are the brown-necked raven (<i>C. ruficollis</i>), the pied crow (<i>C. albus</i>) of Africa, and the Chihuahuan raven (<i>C. cryptoleucus</i>) of the North American Southwest. While some authorities have recognized as many as 11 subspecies, others recognize only eight:</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Evolutionary_history\">Evolutionary history</span></h3>\n<p>The common raven evolved in the Old World and crossed the Bering land bridge into North America. Recent genetic studies, which examined the DNA of common ravens from across the world, have determined that the birds fall into at least two clades: a California clade, found only in the southwestern United States, and a Holarctic clade, found across the rest of the Northern Hemisphere. Birds from both clades look alike, but the groups are genetically distinct and began to diverge about two million years ago.</p><p>The findings indicate that based on mitochondrial DNA, common ravens from the rest of the United States are more closely related to those in Europe and Asia than to those in the California clade, and that common ravens in the California clade are more closely related to the Chihuahuan raven (<i>C. cryptoleucus</i>) than to those in the Holarctic clade. Ravens in the Holarctic clade are more closely related to the pied crow (<i>C. albus</i>) than they are to the California clade. Thus, the common raven species as traditionally delimited is considered to be paraphyletic.</p><p>One explanation for these genetic findings is that common ravens settled in California at least two million years ago and became separated from their relatives in Europe and Asia during an ice age. One million years ago, a group from the California clade evolved into a new species, the Chihuahuan raven. Other members of the Holarctic clade arrived later in a separate migration from Asia, perhaps at the same time as humans.</p><p>A 2011 study suggested that there are no restrictions on gene flow between the Californian and Holarctic common raven groups, and that the lineages can remerge, effectively reversing a potential speciation.</p><p>A recent study of raven mitochondrial DNA showed that the isolated population from the Canary Islands is distinct from other populations. The study did not include any individuals from the North African population, and its position is therefore unclear, though its morphology is very close to the population of the Canaries (to the extent that the two are often considered part of a single subspecies).</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Description\">Description</span></h2>\n\n\n<p>A mature common raven ranges between 54 and 67\u00a0cm (21\" and 26\") long, with a wingspan of 115 to 150\u00a0cm (45\u201351\"). Recorded weights range from 0.69 to 2\u00a0kg (1.5 to 4.4\u00a0lb), thus making the common raven one of the heaviest passerines. Birds from colder regions such as the Himalayas and Greenland are generally larger with slightly larger bills, while those from warmer regions are smaller with proportionally smaller bills. Representative of the size variation in the species, ravens from California weighed an average of 784\u00a0g (1.728\u00a0lb), those from Alaska weighed an average of 1,135\u00a0g (2.502\u00a0lb) and those from Nova Scotia weighed an average of 1,230\u00a0g (2.71\u00a0lb). The bill is large and slightly curved, with a culmen length of 5.7 to 8.5\u00a0cm (2.2 to 3.3\u00a0in), easily one of the largest bills amongst passerines (perhaps only the thick-billed raven has a noticeably larger bill). It has a longish, strongly graduated tail, at 20 to 26.3\u00a0cm (7.9 to 10.4\u00a0in), and mostly black iridescent plumage, and a dark brown iris. The throat feathers are elongated and pointed and the bases of the neck feathers are pale brownish-grey. The legs and feet are good-sized, with a tarsus length of 6 to 7.2\u00a0cm (2.4 to 2.8\u00a0in). Juvenile plumage is similar but duller with a blue-grey iris.</p><p>Apart from its greater size, the common raven differs from its cousins, the crows, by having a larger and heavier black beak, shaggy feathers around the throat and above the beak, and a wedge-shaped tail. Flying ravens are distinguished from crows by their tail shape, larger wing area, and more stable soaring style, which generally involves less wing flapping. Despite their bulk, ravens are easily as agile in flight as their smaller cousins. In flight the feathers produce a creaking sound that has been likened to the rustle of silk. The voice of ravens is also quite distinct, its usual call being a deep croak of a much more sonorous quality than a crow's call. In North America, the Chihuahuan raven (<i>C. cryptoleucus</i>) is fairly similar to the relatively small common ravens of the American southwest and is best distinguished by the still relatively smaller size of its bill, beard and body and relatively longer tail. All-black carrion crow (<i>C. corone</i>) in Europe may suggest a raven due to their largish bill but are still distinctly smaller and have the wing and tail shapes typical of crows.</p><p>In the Faroe Islands, a now-extinct white-and-black colour morph of this species existed, known as the pied raven.</p><p>White ravens are occasionally found in the wild. Birds in British Columbia lack the pink eyes of an albino, and are instead leucistic, a condition where an animal lacks any of several different types of pigment, not simply melanin.</p>\n\n<p>Common ravens have a wide range of vocalizations which are of interest to ornithologists. Gwinner carried out important studies in the early 1960s, recording and photographing his findings in great detail. Fifteen to 30 categories of vocalization have been recorded for this species, most of which are used for social interaction. Calls recorded include alarm calls, chase calls, and flight calls. The species has a distinctive, deep, resonant <i>prruk-prruk-prruk</i> call, which to experienced listeners is unlike that of any other corvid. Its very wide and complex vocabulary includes a high, knocking <i>toc-toc-toc</i>, a dry, grating <i>kraa</i>, a low guttural rattle and some calls of an almost musical nature.</p><p>Like other corvids, ravens can mimic sounds from their environment, including human speech. Non-vocal sounds produced by the common raven include wing whistles and bill snapping. Clapping or clicking has been observed more often in females than in males. If a member of a pair is lost, its mate reproduces the calls of its lost partner to encourage its return.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Distribution_and_habitat\">Distribution and habitat</span></h2>\n\n<p>Common ravens can thrive in varied climates; indeed this species has the largest range of any member of the genus, and one of the largest of any passerine. They range throughout the Holarctic from Arctic and temperate habitats in North America and Eurasia to the deserts of North Africa, and to islands in the Pacific Ocean. In the British Isles, they are more common in Scotland, Wales, northern England and the west of Ireland. In Tibet, they have been recorded at altitudes up to 5,000\u00a0m (16,400\u00a0ft), and as high as 6,350\u00a0m (20,600\u00a0ft) on Mount Everest. The population sometimes known as the Punjab raven\u2014described as <i>Corvus corax laurencei</i> (also spelt <i>lawrencii</i> or <i>laurencii</i>) by Allan Octavian Hume but more often considered synonymous with <i>subcorax</i>\u2014is restricted to the Sindh district of Pakistan and adjoining regions of northwestern India. They are generally resident within their range for the whole year. In his 1950 work, <i>Gr\u00f8nlands Fugle</i> [<i>Birds of Greenland</i>], noted ornithologist Finn Salomonsen indicated that common ravens did not overwinter in the Arctic. However, in Arctic Canada and Alaska, they are found year-round. Young birds may disperse locally.</p><p>Most common ravens prefer wooded areas with large expanses of open land nearby, or coastal regions for their nesting sites and feeding grounds. In some areas of dense human population, such as California in the United States, they take advantage of a plentiful food supply and have seen a surge in their numbers. On coasts, individuals of this species are often evenly distributed and prefer to build their nest sites along sea cliffs. Common ravens are often located in coastal regions because these areas provide easy access to water and a variety of food sources. Also, coastal regions have stable weather patterns without extreme cold or hot temperatures.\n</p><p>In general, common ravens live in a wide array of environments but prefer heavily contoured landscapes. When the environment changes in vast degrees, these birds will respond with a stress response. The hormone known as corticosterone is activated by the hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013adrenal axis. Corticosterone is activated when the bird is exposed to stress, such as migrating great distances.\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Behaviour\">Behaviour</span></h2>\n\n<p>Common ravens usually travel in mated pairs, although young birds may form flocks. Relationships between common ravens are often quarrelsome, yet they demonstrate considerable devotion to their families.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Predation\">Predation</span></h3>\n<p>Owing to its size, gregariousness and its defensive abilities, the common raven has few natural predators. Predators of its eggs include owls, martens, and sometimes eagles. Ravens are quite vigorous at defending their young and are usually successful at driving off perceived threats. They attack potential predators by flying at them and lunging with their large bills. Humans are occasionally attacked if they get close to a raven nest, though serious injuries are unlikely. There are a few records of predation by large birds of prey. Their attackers in America have reportedly included great horned owls, northern goshawks, bald eagles, golden eagles and red-tailed hawks. It is possible that the two hawk species only attack young ravens; in one instance a peregrine falcon swooped at a newly fledged raven but was chased off by the parent ravens.</p><p>In Eurasia, their reported predators include, in addition to golden eagles, Eurasian eagle-owls, white-tailed eagles, Steller's sea-eagles, eastern imperial eagles and gyrfalcons. Because they are potentially hazardous prey for raptorial birds, raptors must usually take them by surprise and most attacks are on fledgling ravens. More rarely still, large mammalian predators such as lynxes, coyotes and cougars have also attacked ravens. This principally occurs at a nest site and when other prey for the carnivores are scarce. Ravens are highly wary around novel carrion sites and, in North America, have been recorded waiting for the presence of American crows and blue jays before approaching to eat.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Breeding\">Breeding</span></h3>\n\n\n<p>Juveniles begin to court at a very early age, but may not bond for another two or three years. Aerial acrobatics, demonstrations of intelligence, and ability to provide food are key behaviors of courting. Once paired, they tend to nest together for life, usually in the same location. Instances of non-monogamy have been observed in common ravens, by males visiting a female's nest when her mate is away.</p><p>Breeding pairs must have a territory of their own before they begin nest-building and reproduction, and thus aggressively defend a territory and its food resources. Nesting territories vary in size according to the density of food resources in the area. The nest is a deep bowl made of large sticks and twigs, bound with an inner layer of roots, mud, and bark and lined with a softer material, such as deer fur. The nest is usually placed in a large tree or on a cliff ledge, or less frequently in old buildings or utility poles.</p><p>Females lay between three and seven pale bluish-green, brown-blotched eggs. Incubation is about 18 to 21 days, by the female only. The male may stand or crouch over the young, sheltering but not actually brooding them. Young fledge at 35 to 42 days, and are fed by both parents. They stay with their parents for another six months after fledging.</p><p>In most of their range, egg-laying begins in late February. In colder climates, it is later, e.g. April in Greenland and Tibet. In Pakistan, egg-laying takes place in December. Eggs and hatchlings are preyed on, rarely, by large hawks and eagles, large owls, martens and canids. The adults, which are very rarely preyed upon, are often successful in defending their young from these predators, due to their numbers, large size and cunning. They have been observed dropping stones on potential predators that venture close to their nests.</p><p>Common ravens can be very long-lived, especially in captive or protected conditions; individuals at the Tower of London have lived for more than 40 years. Lifespans in the wild are considerably shorter at typically 10 to 15 years. The longest known lifespan of a banded wild common raven was 23 years, 3 months.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Feeding\">Feeding</span></h3>\n\n<p>Common ravens are omnivorous and highly opportunistic: their diet may vary widely with location, season and serendipity. For example, those foraging on tundra on the Arctic North Slope of Alaska obtained about half their energy needs from predation, mainly of microtine rodents, and half by scavenging, mainly of caribou and ptarmigan carcasses.</p><p>In some places they are mainly scavengers, feeding on carrion as well as the associated maggots and carrion beetles. With large-bodied carrion, which they are not equipped to tear through as well as birds such as hook-billed vultures, they must wait for the prey to be torn open by another predator or flayed by other means. Plant food includes cereal grains, berries and fruit. They prey on small invertebrates, amphibians, reptiles, small mammals and birds. Ravens may also consume the undigested portions of animal feces, and human food waste. They store surplus food items, especially those containing fat, and will learn to hide such food out of the sight of other common ravens. Ravens also raid the food caches of other species, such as the Arctic fox. They sometimes associate with another canine, the grey wolf, as a kleptoparasite, following to scavenge wolf-kills in winter. Ravens are regular predators at bird nests, brazenly picking off eggs, nestlings and sometimes adult birds when they spot an opportunity. They are considered perhaps the primary natural threat to the nesting success of the critically endangered California condor, since they readily take condor eggs and are very common in the areas where the species is being re-introduced. On the other hand, when they defend their own adjacent nests, they may incidentally benefit condors since they chase golden eagles out of the area that may otherwise prey upon larger nestling and fledging condors. Condors, despite their large size, do not seem to have well developed nest defenses.</p>\n\n<p>Common ravens nesting near sources of human garbage included a higher percentage of food waste in their diet, birds nesting near roads consumed more road-killed vertebrates, and those nesting far from these sources of food ate more arthropods and plant material. Fledging success was higher for those using human garbage as a food source. In contrast, a 1984\u20131986 study of common raven diet in an agricultural region of south-western Idaho found that cereal grains were the principal constituent of pellets, though small mammals, grasshoppers, cattle carrion and birds were also eaten.</p><p>One behavior is recruitment, where juvenile ravens call other ravens to a food bonanza, usually a carcass, with a series of loud yells. In <i>Ravens in Winter,</i> Bernd Heinrich posited that this behavior evolved to allow the juveniles to outnumber the resident adults, thus allowing them to feed on the carcass without being chased away. A more mundane explanation is that individuals co-operate in sharing information about carcasses of large mammals because they are too big for just a few birds to exploit. Experiments with baits however show that such recruitment behaviour is independent of the size of the bait.</p><p>Furthermore, there has been research suggesting that the common raven is involved in seed dispersal. In the wild, the common raven chooses the best habitat and disperses seeds in locations best suited for its survival.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Intelligence\">Intelligence</span></h3>\n\n<blockquote class=\"templatequote\"><p>Crows, ravens, magpies, and jays are not just feathered machines, rigidly programmed by their genetics. Instead, they are beings that, within the constraints of their molecular inheritance, make complex decisions and show every sign of enjoying a rich awareness.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The brains of common ravens count among the largest of any bird species. Specifically, their hyperpallium is large for a bird. They display ability in problem-solving, as well as other cognitive processes such as imitation and insight.</p>\n\n<p>Linguist Derek Bickerton, building on the work of biologist Bernd Heinrich, has argued that ravens are one of only four known animals (the others being bees, ants, and humans) who have demonstrated displacement, the capacity to communicate about objects or events that are distant in space or time from the communication. Young, unmated common ravens roost together at night, but usually forage alone during the day. However, when one discovers a large carcass guarded by a pair of adult ravens, the unmated raven will return to the roost and communicate the find. The following day, a flock of unmated ravens will fly to the carcass and chase off the adults. Bickerton argues that the advent of linguistic displacement was perhaps the most important event in the evolution of human language, and that ravens are the only other vertebrate to share this with humans.</p><p>One experiment designed to evaluate insight and problem-solving ability involved a piece of meat attached to a string hanging from a perch. To reach the food, the bird needed to stand on the perch, pull the string up a little at a time, and step on the loops to gradually shorten the string. Four of five common ravens eventually succeeded, and \"the transition from no success (ignoring the food or merely yanking at the string) to constant reliable access (pulling up the meat) occurred with no demonstrable trial-and-error learning.\" This supports the hypothesis that common ravens are 'inventors', implying that they can solve problems. Many of the feats of common ravens were formerly argued to be stereotyped innate behaviour, but it now has been established that their aptitudes for solving problems individually and learning from each other reflect a flexible capacity for intelligent insight unusual among non-human animals.</p><p>Another experiment proved that some could deceive intentionally at least to other common ravens.</p><p>Common ravens have been observed calling wolves to the site of dead animals. The wolves open the carcass, leaving the scraps more accessible to the birds. They watch where other common ravens bury their food and remember the locations of each other's food caches, so they can steal from them. This type of theft occurs so regularly that common ravens will fly extra distances from a food source to find better hiding places for food. They have also been observed pretending to make a cache without actually depositing the food, presumably to confuse onlookers.</p><p>Common ravens are known to steal and cache shiny objects such as pebbles, pieces of metal, and golf balls. One theory is that they hoard shiny objects to impress other ravens. Other research indicates that juveniles are deeply curious about all new things, and that common ravens retain an attraction to bright, round objects based on their similarity to bird eggs. Mature birds lose their intense interest in the unusual, and become highly neophobic.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Play\">Play</span></h3>\n<p>There has been increasing recognition of the extent to which birds engage in play. Juvenile common ravens are among the most playful of bird species. They have been observed to slide down snowbanks, apparently purely for fun. They even engage in games with other species, such as playing catch-me-if-you-can with wolves, otters and dogs. Common ravens are known for spectacular aerobatic displays, such as flying in loops or interlocking talons with each other in flight.</p><p>They are also one of only a few wild animals who make their own toys. They have been observed breaking off twigs to play with socially.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Relationship_with_humans\">Relationship with humans</span></h2>\n<h3><span id=\"Conservation_and_management\">Conservation and management</span></h3>\n<p>Compared to many smaller <i>Corvus</i> species (such as American crow), ravens prefer undisturbed mountain or forest habitat or rural areas over urban areas. In other areas, their numbers have increased dramatically and they have become agricultural pests. Common ravens can cause damage to crops, such as nuts and grain, or can harm livestock, particularly by killing young goat kids, lambs and calves. Ravens generally attack the faces of young livestock, but the more common raven behaviour of scavenging may be misidentified as predation by ranchers.</p><p>In the western Mojave Desert, human settlement and land development have led to an estimated 16-fold increase in the common raven population over 25 years. Towns, landfills, sewage treatment plants and artificial ponds create sources of food and water for scavenging birds. Ravens also find nesting sites in utility poles and ornamental trees, and are attracted to roadkill on highways. The explosion in the common raven population in the Mojave has raised concerns for the desert tortoise, a threatened species. Common ravens prey upon juvenile tortoises, which have soft shells and move slowly. Plans to control the population have included shooting and trapping birds, as well as contacting landfill operators to ask that they reduce the amount of exposed garbage. A hunting bounty as a method of control was historically used in Finland from the mid-18th century until 1923. Culling has taken place to a limited extent in Alaska, where the population increase in common ravens is threatening the vulnerable Steller's eider (<i>Polysticta stelleri</i>).</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Cultural_depictions\">Cultural depictions</span></h3>\n\n\n<p>Across its range in the Northern Hemisphere, and throughout human history, the common raven has been a powerful symbol and a popular subject of mythology and folklore.\n</p><p>In some Western traditions, ravens have long been considered to be birds of ill omen, death and evil in general, in part because of the negative symbolism of their all-black plumage and the eating of carrion. In Sweden, ravens are known as the ghosts of murdered people, and in Germany as the souls of the damned. In Danish folklore, valravne that ate a king's heart gained human knowledge, could perform great malicious acts, could lead people astray, had superhuman powers, and were \"terrible animals\".</p><p>As in traditional mythology and folklore, the common raven features frequently in more modern writings such as the works of William Shakespeare, and, perhaps most famously, in the poem \"The Raven\" by Edgar Allan Poe. Ravens have appeared in the works of Charles Dickens, J. R. R. Tolkien, Stephen King, George R. R. Martin and Joan Aiken among others.\n</p><p>It continues to be used as a symbol in areas where it once had mythological status: as the national bird of Bhutan (Kings of Bhutan wear the Raven Crown), official bird of the Yukon territory, and on the coat of arms of the Isle of Man (once a Viking colony).</p><p>In Persia and Arabia the raven was held as a bird of bad omen but a 14th-century Arabic work reports use of the raven in falconry.</p><p>The modern unisex given name <i>Raven</i> is derived from the English word \"raven\". As a masculine name, <i>Raven</i> parallels the Old Norse <i>Hrafn</i>, and Old English <i>*Hr\u00e6fn</i>, which were both bynames and personal names.</p>\n<h4><span id=\"Mythology\">Mythology</span></h4>\n\n\n<p>In Tlingit and Haida cultures, Raven was both a trickster and creator god. Related beliefs are widespread among the peoples of Siberia and northeastern Asia. The Kamchatka Peninsula, for example, was supposed to have been created by the raven god Kutkh. There are several references to common ravens in the Old Testament of the Bible and it is an aspect of Mahakala in Bhutanese mythology.</p><p>In Norse mythology, Huginn (from the Old Norse for \"thought\") and Muninn (from the Old Norse for \"memory\" or \"mind\") are a pair of ravens that fly all over the world of humans, Midgard, and bring the god Odin information. Additionally among the Norse, raven banner standards were carried by such figures as the Jarls of Orkney, King Cnut the Great of England, Norway and Denmark, and Harald Hardrada. In the British Isles, ravens also were symbolic to the Celts. In Irish mythology, the goddess Morr\u00edgan alighted on the hero C\u00fa Chulainn's shoulder in the form of a raven after his death. In Welsh mythology they were associated with the Welsh god Bran the Blessed, whose name translates to \"raven.\" According to the <i>Mabinogion</i>, Bran's head was buried in the White Hill of London as a talisman against invasion.</p><p>A legend developed that England would not fall to a foreign invader as long as there were ravens at the Tower of London; although this is often thought to be an ancient belief, the official Tower of London historian, Geoff Parnell, believes that this is actually a romantic Victorian invention.</p><p>In the Jewish, Christian and Islamic traditions, the raven was the first animal to be released from Noah's Ark. \"So it came to pass, at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made. Then he sent out a raven, which kept going to and fro until the waters had dried up from the earth. He also sent out from himself a dove, to see if the waters had receded from the face of the ground.\" The raven is mentioned 12 times in the Bible. In the New Testament Jesus tells a parable using the raven to show how people should rely on God for their needs and not riches (Luke 12:24). The raven is also mentioned in the Quran at the story of Cain and Abel. Adam's firstborn son Cain kills his brother Abel, but he does not know what to do with the corpse: \"Then Allah sent a raven scratching up the ground, to show him how to hide his brother's naked corpse. He said: Woe unto me! Am I not able to be as this raven and so hide my brother's naked corpse? And he became repentant.\"</p>\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n\n<h3><span id=\"Cited_texts\">Cited texts</span></h3>\n<ul><li><cite id=\"Goodwin\" class=\"citation book\">Goodwin D.

The genus name <i>Tringa</i> is the New Latin name given to the green sandpiper by Aldrovandus in 1599 based on Ancient Greek <i>trungas</i>, a thrush-sized, white-rumped, tail-bobbing wading bird mentioned by Aristotle. The specific <i>totanus</i> is from <i>T\u00f3tano</i>, the Italian name for this bird.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span id=\"Description_and_systematics\">Description and systematics</span></h2>\n\n\n<p>Common redshanks in breeding plumage are a marbled brown color, slightly lighter below. In winter plumage they become somewhat lighter-toned and less patterned, being rather plain greyish-brown above and whitish below. They have red legs and a black-tipped red bill, and show white up the back and on the wings in flight.\n</p><p>The spotted redshank (<i>T. erythropus</i>), which breeds in the Arctic, has a longer bill and legs; it is almost entirely black in breeding plumage and very pale in winter. It is not a particularly close relative of the common redshank, but rather belongs to a high-latitude lineage of largish shanks. <i>T. totanus</i> on the other hand is closely related to the marsh sandpiper (<i>T. stagnatilis</i>), and closer still to the small wood sandpiper (<i>T. glareola</i>). The ancestors of the latter and the common redshank seem to have diverged around the Miocene-Pliocene boundary, about 5\u20136 million years ago. These three subarctic- to temperate-region species form a group of smallish shanks with have red or yellowish legs, and in breeding plumage are generally a subdued light brown above with some darker mottling, and have somewhat diffuse small brownish spots on the breast and neck.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Subspecies\">Subspecies</span></h2>\n<p>Several subspecies have been identified. These include:\n</p>\n<ul><li><i>T. t. robusta</i> - <small>(Schi\u00f8ler, 1919)</small>: found in Iceland and the Faroe Islands.</li>\n<li><i>T. t. ussuriensis</i> - <small>Buturlin, 1934</small>:  found in southern Siberia, Mongolia and east Asia</li>\n<li><i>T. t. terrignotae</i> - <small>Meinertzhagen, R. &amp; Meinertzhagen, A., 1926</small>: found in southern Manchuria and eastern China</li>\n<li><i>T. t. craggi</i> - <small>Hale, 1971</small>: found in north west China</li>\n<li><i>T. t. eurhina</i> - <small>(Oberholser, 1900)</small>: found in Tajikistan, north India and Tibet</li></ul><h2><span id=\"Ecology\">Ecology</span></h2>\n<p>The common redshank is a widespread breeding bird across temperate Eurasia. It is a migratory species, wintering on coasts around the Mediterranean, on the Atlantic coast of Europe from Ireland and Great Britain southwards, and in South Asia. They are uncommon vagrants outside these areas; on Palau in Micronesia for example, the species was recorded in the mid-1970s and in 2000.</p>\n\n<p>They are wary and noisy birds which will alert everything else with their loud piping call. Like most waders, they feed on small invertebrates. Redshanks will nest in any wetland, from damp meadows to saltmarsh, often at high densities. They lay 3\u20135 eggs.\n</p><p>The common redshank is one of the species to which the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA) applies.\n</p><p>It is widely distributed and quite plentiful in some regions, and thus not considered a threatened species by the IUCN.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n\n<h2><span id=\"External_links\">External links</span></h2>\n<ul><li><cite id=\"CITEREFChisholm1911\" class=\"citation encyclopaedia\">Chisholm, Hugh, ed.

This bird and its American sister species, the spotted sandpiper (<i>A. macularia</i>), make up the genus <i>Actitis</i>. They are parapatric and replace each other geographically; stray birds of either species may settle down with breeders of the other and hybridize. Hybridization has also been reported between the common sandpiper and the green sandpiper, a basal species of the closely related shank genus <i>Tringa</i>.\n</p>\n\n\n<h2><span id=\"Taxonomy\">Taxonomy</span></h2>\n<p>The common sandpiper was one of the many bird species originally described by Linnaeus in the landmark 1758 10th edition of his <i>Systema Naturae</i>, where it was given the binomial name of <i>Tringa hypoleucos</i>. The current scientific name is from Ancient Greek. <i>Actitis</i> is from <i>aktites</i>, \"coast-dweller\" derived from <i>akte</i>, \"coast\", and <i>hypoleucos</i> is from <i>hupo</i>, \"beneath\", and <i>leukos</i> \"white\".</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Description\">Description</span></h2>\n<p>The adult is 18\u201320\u00a0cm (7.1\u20137.9\u00a0in) long with a 32\u201335\u00a0cm (13\u201314\u00a0in) wingspan. It has greyish-brown upperparts, white underparts, short dark-yellowish legs and feet, and a bill with a pale base and dark tip. In winter plumage, they are duller and have more conspicuous barring on the wings, though this is still only visible at close range. Juveniles are more heavily barred above and have buff edges to the wing feathers.</p><p>This species is very similar to the slightly larger spotted sandpiper (<i>A. macularia</i>) in non-breeding plumage. But its darker legs and feet and the crisper wing pattern (visible in flight) tend to give it away, and of course they are only rarely found in the same location.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Ecology\">Ecology</span></h2>\n<p>It is a gregarious bird and is seen in large flocks, and has the distinctive stiff-winged flight, low over the water, of <i>Actitis</i> waders. The common sandpiper breeds across most of temperate and subtropical Europe and Asia, and migrates to Africa, southern Asia and Australia in winter. The eastern edge of its migration route passes by Palau in Micronesia, where hundreds of birds may gather for a stop-over. They depart the Palau region for their breeding quarters around the last week of April to the first week of May.</p>\n\n\n<p>The common sandpiper forages by sight on the ground or in shallow water, picking up small food items such as insects, crustaceans and other invertebrates; it may even catch insects in flight. In the Nukumanu language of the Nukumanu Islands (Papua New Guinea), this species is usually called <i><b>tiritavoi</b></i>. Another Nukumanu name for it, <i><b>matakakoni</b></i>, exists, but this is considered somewhat taboo and not used when children and women are around. The reason for this is that <i>matakakoni</i> means \"bird that walks a little, then copulates\", in reference to the pumping tail and thrusting head movements the <i>Actitis</i> species characteristically perform during foraging.</p><p>It nests on the ground near freshwater. When threatened, the young may cling to their parent's body to be flown away to safety.</p><p>The common sandpiper is one of the species to which the <i>Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds</i> (AEWA) applies.\n</p><p>It is widespread and common, and therefore classified as a species of least concern by the IUCN but is a vulnerable species in some states of Australia.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n\n<h2><span id=\"External_links\">External links</span></h2>\n<ul><li>Ageing and sexing (PDF; 5.5 MB) by Javier Blasco-Zumeta &amp; Gerd-Michael Heinze</li>\n<li>Common sandpiper species text in The Atlas of Southern African Birds</li>\n<li>BirdLife species factsheet for <i>Actitis hypoleucos</i></li>\n<li><cite class=\"citation web\">\"Actitis hypoleucos\". <i>Avibase</i>.</cite><span title=\"ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rft.genre=unknown&amp;rft.jtitle=Avibase&amp;rft.atitle=Actitis+hypoleucos&amp;rft_id=https%3A%2F%2Favibase.bsc-eoc.org%2Fspecies.jsp%3Flang%3DEN%26avibaseid%3D8548B07ECA48773F&amp;rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fen.wikipedia.org%3ACommon+sandpiper\"></span><link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r951705291\"> </li>\n<li><cite class=\"citation web\">\"Common sandpiper media\". <i>Internet Bird Collection</i>.</cite><span title=\"ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rft.genre=unknown&amp;rft.jtitle=Internet+Bird+Collection&amp;rft.atitle=Common+sandpiper+media&amp;rft_id=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.hbw.com%2Fibc%2Fspecies%2Fcommon-sandpiper-actitis-hypoleucos&amp;rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fen.wikipedia.org%3ACommon+sandpiper\"></span><link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r951705291\"></li>\n<li>Common sandpiper photo gallery at VIREO (Drexel University)</li>\n<li>Interactive range map of <i>Actitis hypoleucos</i> at IUCN Red List maps</li>\n<li>Audio recordings of Common sandpiper on Xeno-canto.</li>\n<li><i>Actitis hypoleucos</i> in the Flickr: Field Guide Birds of the World</li>\n<li>Common sandpiper media from ARKive </li></ul>"

It is widespread and common in the Euro-Siberian region of the Palearctic, mainly breeding in temperate and wintering in subtropical regions; in winter, it can also be found in the Maghreb. Its scientific name comes from the French name <i>Tadorne</i> for this species. It may originally derive from Celtic roots meaning \"pied waterfowl\", essentially the same as the English \"shelduck\".</p><p>Fossil bones from Dorkovo (Bulgaria) described as <i><b>Balcanas pliocaenica</b></i> may actually belong to this species. More likely, they are an extinct species of <i>Tadorna</i> (if not a distinct genus) due to their Early Pliocene age; the present species is not unequivocally attested from the fossil record until some 2\u20133 million years later (Late Pliocene/Early Pleistocene).\n</p>\n\n\n<h2><span id=\"Description\">Description</span></h2>\n\n<p>The common shelduck resembles a small short-necked goose in size and shape. It is a striking bird, with a reddish-pink bill, pink feet, a white body with chestnut patches and a black belly, and a dark green head and neck. The wing coverts are white, the primary remiges black, and the secondaries green (only showing in flight) and chestnut. The underwings are almost entirely white. Sexes are similar, but the female is smaller, with some white facial markings, while the male is particularly crisply coloured in the breeding season, his bill bright red and bearing a prominent knob at the forehead.\n</p><p>Ducklings are white, with black cap, hindneck and wing and back patches. Juveniles are similarly coloured, greyish above and mostly white below, but already have the adult's wing pattern.\n</p><p>The call is a loud honk.\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Distribution_and_habitat\">Distribution and habitat</span></h2>\n<p>This is a bird which breeds in temperate Eurosiberia. Most populations migrate to subtropical areas in winter, but this species is largely resident in westernmost Europe, apart from movements to favoured moulting grounds, such as the Wadden Sea on the north German coast.\n</p><p>The common shelduck is common around the coastline of Great Britain and Ireland (where it is simply known as shelduck), where it frequents salt marshes and estuaries.

The scientific name <i>gallinago</i> is New Latin for a woodcock or snipe from Latin <i>gallina</i>, \"hen\" and the suffix <i>-ago</i>, \"resembling\".</p><p>The breeding habitat is marshes, bogs, tundra and wet meadows throughout the Palearctic.In the north, the distribution limit extends from Iceland over the north of the British Isles and northern Fennoscandia , where it occurs at around 70 \u00b0 N, as well as through European Russia and Siberia . Here it is mostly on the northern edge of the Taiga zone at 71 \u00b0 N, but reaches 74 \u00b0 N on the east coast of the Taymyr Peninsula. In the east it extends to the Anadyr, Kamchatka, the Bering Island and the Kuril Islands, The southern boundary of the distribution area in Europe runs through northern Portugal, central France, northern Italy, Bulgaria and the Ukraine, with populations in the west being only very scattered. In Asia, the distribution extends south to northern Turkestan, locally to Afghanistan and the Middle East, through the Altai and further to Manchuria and Ussuri. It is migratory, with European birds wintering in southern and western Europe and Africa (south to the Equator), and Asian migrants moving to tropical southern Asia. The North American Wilson's snipe was previously considered the same species, and is listed as such in older field guides.\n</p>\n\n\n<h2><span id=\"Description\">Description</span></h2>\n\n<p>Adults are 25\u201327\u00a0cm (9.8\u201310.6\u00a0in) in length with a 44\u201347\u00a0cm (17\u201319\u00a0in) wingspan and a weight of 80\u2013140\u00a0g (2.8\u20134.9\u00a0oz) (up to 180\u00a0g (6.3\u00a0oz) pre-migration). They have short greenish-grey legs and a very long (5.5\u20137\u00a0cm (2.2\u20132.8\u00a0in)) straight dark bill. The body is mottled brown with straw-yellow stripes on top and pale underneath. They have a dark stripe through the eye, with light stripes above and below it. The wings are pointed.</p><p>It is the most widespread of several similar snipes. It most closely resembles the Wilson's snipe (<i>G. delicata</i>) of North America, which was until recently considered to be a subspecies \u2014 <i>G. g. delicata</i> \u2014 of common snipe. They differ in the number of tail feathers, with seven pairs in <i>G. gallinago</i> and eight pairs in <i>G. delicata</i>; the North American species also has a slightly thinner white trailing edge to the wings (the white is mostly on the tips of the secondaries). Both species breed in the Aleutian Islands. It is also very similar to the pin-tailed snipe (<i>G. stenura</i>) and Swinhoe's snipe (<i>G. megala</i>) of eastern Asia; identification of these species there is complex.</p><p>There are two subspecies of common snipe, <i>G. g. faeroeensis</i> in Iceland, the Faroes, Shetland and Orkney (wintering in Britain and Ireland), and <i>G. g. gallinago</i> in the rest of the Old World. The <i>faeroeensis</i> normally is more richly toned on the breast, its upperparts and the head than the <i>gallinago</i>.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Ecology\">Ecology</span></h2>\n\n\n<p>It is a well camouflaged bird, it is usually shy and conceals itself close to ground vegetation and flushes only when approached closely. When flushed, they utter a sharp note that sounds like <i>scape, scape</i> and fly off in a series of aerial zig-zags to confuse predators. They forage in soft mud, probing or picking up food by sight. They mainly eat insects and earthworms, also some plant material.</p>\n<p>The male performs \"winnowing\" display during courtship, flying high in circles and then taking shallow dives to produce a \"drumming\" sound by vibrating its tail feathers. This sound has been compared by others to the bleating of a sheep or goat; hence in many languages the snipe is known by names signifying \u201cflying goat,\u201d \u201cheaven's ram,\u201d as in Scotland by \u201cheather-bleater\u201d and in Finnish the name <i>taivaanvuohi</i>, \"sky goat\".\n</p><p>Philip Manson-Bahr is credited with unravelling the mystery of how the snipe creates that unusual breathy sound which is unlike other birdsong. He worked out that the sound was created by placing out two tail feathers at 90 degrees to the direction of flight. When diving these feathers create this unusual sound. He demonstrated this in front of the British Ornithologists Union by inserting two snipe feathers into a cork which he then whirled around his head on a string.</p><p>Wing shape does not differ between sedentary and migratory common snipe, suggesting that social selection influences wing shape given this species aerial displays during courtship.</p><p>Common snipe nest in a well-hidden location on the ground, laying four eggs of a dark olive colour, blotched and spotted with rich brown, which are incubated by the female for 18\u201321 days. The freshly hatched young are covered in dark maroon down, variegated with black, white and buff. The young are cared for by both parents, each parent looking after half the brood, with fledging in 10\u201320 days.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Conservation\">Conservation</span></h2>\n\n<p>Overall, the species is not threatened. Populations on the southern fringes of the breeding range in Europe are however declining with local extinction in some areas (notably in parts of England and Germany), mainly due to field drainage and agricultural intensification.</p><p>The Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA) applies to the species.

        "details": " <p class=\"mw-empty-elt\">\n\n\n</p>\n<p>The <b>common starling</b> (<i>Sturnus vulgaris</i>), also known as the <b>European starling</b> in the United States or simply the <b>starling</b> in the British Isles, is a medium-sized passerine bird in the starling family, Sturnidae. It is about 20\u00a0cm (8\u00a0in) long and has glossy black plumage with a metallic sheen, which is speckled with white at some times of year. The legs are pink and the bill is black in winter and yellow in summer; young birds have browner plumage than the adults. It is a noisy bird, especially in communal roosts and other gregarious situations, with an unmusical but varied song. Its gift for mimicry has been noted in literature including the <i>Mabinogion</i> and the works of Pliny the Elder and William Shakespeare.\n</p><p>The common starling has about 12 subspecies breeding in open habitats across its native range in temperate Europe and across the Palearctic to western Mongolia, and it has been introduced to Australia, New Zealand, Canada, the United States, Mexico, Argentina, South Africa and Fiji. This bird is resident in western and southern Europe and southwestern Asia, while northeastern populations migrate south and west in the winter within the breeding range and also further south to Iberia and North Africa. The common starling builds an untidy nest in a natural or artificial cavity in which four or five glossy, pale blue eggs are laid. These take two weeks to hatch and the young remain in the nest for another three weeks. There are normally one or two breeding attempts each year. This species is omnivorous, taking a wide range of invertebrates, as well as seeds and fruit. It is hunted by various mammals and birds of prey, and is host to a range of external and internal parasites.\n</p><p>Large flocks typical of this species can be beneficial to agriculture by controlling invertebrate pests; however, starlings can also be pests themselves when they feed on fruit and sprouting crops. Common starlings may also be a nuisance through the noise and mess caused by their large urban roosts. Introduced populations in particular have been subjected to a range of controls, including culling, but these have had limited success, except in preventing the colonisation of Western Australia.\n</p><p>The species has declined in numbers in parts of northern and western Europe since the 1980s due to fewer grassland invertebrates being available as food for growing chicks. Despite this, its huge global population is not thought to be declining significantly, so the common starling is classified as being of Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.\n</p>\n\n\n<h2><span id=\"Taxonomy_and_systematics\">Taxonomy and systematics</span></h2>\n<p>The common starling was first described by Carl Linnaeus in his <i>Systema Naturae</i> in 1758 under its current binomial name. <i>Sturnus</i> and <i>vulgaris</i> are derived from the Latin for \"starling\" and \"common\" respectively. The Old English <i>staer</i>, later <i>stare</i>, and the Latin <i>sturnus</i> are both derived from an unknown Indo-European root dating back to the second millennium BC. \"Starling\" was first recorded in the 11th century, when it referred to the juvenile of the species, but by the 16th century it had already largely supplanted \"stare\" to refer to birds of all ages. The older name is referenced in William Butler Yeats' poem \"The Stare's Nest by My Window\". The International Ornithological Congress' preferred English vernacular name is common starling.</p><p>The starling family, Sturnidae, is an entirely Old World group apart from introductions elsewhere, with the greatest numbers of species in Southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. The genus <i>Sturnus</i> is polyphyletic and relationships between its members are not fully resolved. The closest relation of the common starling is the spotless starling. The non-migratory spotless starling may be descended from a population of ancestral <i>S. vulgaris</i> that survived in an Iberian refugium during an Ice Age retreat, and mitochondrial gene studies suggest that it could be considered a subspecies of the common starling. There is more genetic variation between common starling populations than between the nominate common starling and the spotless starling. Although common starling remains are known from the Middle Pleistocene, part of the problem in resolving relationships in the Sturnidae is the paucity of the fossil record for the family as a whole.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Subspecies\">Subspecies</span></h3>\n<p>There are several subspecies of the common starling, which vary clinally in size and the colour tone of the adult plumage. The gradual variation over geographic range and extensive intergradation means that acceptance of the various subspecies varies between authorities.</p>\n<ul class=\"gallery mw-gallery-packed center\"><li class=\"gallerycaption\">Subspecies</li>\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 169.33333333333px\">\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 263.33333333333px\">\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 149.33333333333px\">\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 334px\">\n</ul><p>Birds from Fair Isle, St. Kilda and the Outer Hebrides are intermediate in size between <i>S. v. zetlandicus</i> and the nominate form, and their subspecies placement varies according to the authority. The dark juveniles typical of these island forms are occasionally found in mainland Scotland and elsewhere, indicating some gene flow from <i>faroensis</i> or <i>zetlandicus</i>, subspecies formerly considered to be isolated.</p><p>Several other subspecies have been named, but are generally no longer considered valid. Most are intergrades that occur where the ranges of various subspecies meet. These include: <i>S. v. ruthenus</i> Menzbier, 1891 and <i>S. v. jitkowi</i> Buturlin, 1904, which are intergrades between <i>vulgaris</i> and <i>poltaratskyi</i> from western Russia; <i>S. v. graecus</i> Tschusi, 1905 and <i>S. v. balcanicus</i> Buturlin and Harms, 1909, which are intergrades between <i>vulgaris</i> and <i>tauricus</i> from the southern Balkans to central Ukraine and throughout Greece to the Bosporus; and <i>S. v. heinrichi</i> Stresemann, 1928, an intergrade between <i>caucasicus</i> and <i>nobilior</i> in northern Iran. <i>S. v. persepolis</i> Ticehurst, 1928 from southern Iran's (Fars Province) is very similar to <i>vulgaris</i>, and it is not clear whether it is a distinct resident population or simply migrants from southeastern Europe.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Description\">Description</span></h2>\n\n<p>The common starling is 19\u201323\u00a0cm (7.5\u20139.1\u00a0in) long, with a wingspan of 31\u201344\u00a0cm (12\u201317\u00a0in) and a weight of 58\u2013101\u00a0g (2.0\u20133.6\u00a0oz). Among standard measurements, the wing chord is 11.8 to 13.8\u00a0cm (4.6 to 5.4\u00a0in), the tail is 5.8 to 6.8\u00a0cm (2.3 to 2.7\u00a0in), the culmen is 2.5 to 3.2\u00a0cm (0.98 to 1.26\u00a0in) and the tarsus is 2.7 to 3.2\u00a0cm (1.1 to 1.3\u00a0in). The plumage is iridescent black, glossed purple or green, and spangled with white, especially in winter. The underparts of adult male common starlings are less spotted than those of adult females at a given time of year. The throat feathers of males are long and loose and are used in display while those of females are smaller and more pointed. The legs are stout and pinkish- or greyish-red. The bill is narrow and conical with a sharp tip; in the winter it is brownish-black but in summer, females have lemon yellow beaks while males have yellow bills with blue-grey bases. Moulting occurs once a year- in late summer after the breeding season has finished; the fresh feathers are prominently tipped white (breast feathers) or buff (wing and back feathers), which gives the bird a speckled appearance. The reduction in the spotting in the breeding season is achieved through the white feather tips largely wearing off. Juveniles are grey-brown and by their first winter resemble adults though often retaining some brown juvenile feathering, especially on the head. They can usually be sexed by the colour of the irises, rich brown in males, mouse-brown or grey in females. Estimating the contrast between an iris and the central always-dark pupil is 97% accurate in determining sex, rising to 98% if the length of the throat feathers is also considered. The common starling is mid-sized by both starling standards and passerine standards. It is readily distinguished from other mid-sized passerines, such as thrushes, icterids or small corvids, by its relatively short tail, sharp, blade-like bill, round-bellied shape and strong, sizeable (and rufous-coloured) legs. In flight, its strongly pointed wings and dark colouration are distinctive, while on the ground its strange, somewhat waddling gait is also characteristic. The colouring and build usually distinguish this bird from other starlings, although the closely related spotless starling may be physically distinguished by the lack of iridescent spots in adult breeding plumage.</p>\n\n<p>Like most terrestrial starlings the common starling moves by walking or running, rather than hopping. Their flight is quite strong and direct; their triangular-shaped wings beat very rapidly, and periodically the birds glide for a short way without losing much height before resuming powered flight. When in a flock, the birds take off almost simultaneously, wheel and turn in unison, form a compact mass or trail off into a wispy stream, bunch up again and land in a coordinated fashion. Common starling on migration can fly at 60\u201380\u00a0km/h (37\u201350\u00a0mph) and cover up to 1,000\u20131,500\u00a0km (620\u2013930\u00a0mi).</p><p>Several terrestrial starlings, including those in the genus <i>Sturnus</i>, have adaptations of the skull and muscles that help with feeding by probing. This adaptation is most strongly developed in the common starling (along with the spotless and white-cheeked starlings), where the protractor muscles responsible for opening the jaw are enlarged and the skull is narrow, allowing the eye to be moved forward to peer down the length of the bill. This technique involves inserting the bill into the ground and opening it as a way of searching for hidden food items. Common starlings have the physical traits that enable them to use this feeding technique, which has undoubtedly helped the species spread far and wide.</p><p>In Iberia, the western Mediterranean and northwest Africa, the common starling may be confused with the closely related spotless starling, the plumage of which, as its name implies, has a more uniform colour. At close range it can be seen that the latter has longer throat feathers, a fact particularly noticeable when it sings.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Vocalization\">Vocalization</span></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The common starling is a noisy bird. Its song consists of a wide variety of both melodic and mechanical-sounding noises as part of a ritual succession of sounds. The male is the main songster and engages in bouts of song lasting for a minute or more. Each of these typically includes four varieties of song type, which follow each other in a regular order without pause. The bout starts with a series of pure-tone whistles and these are followed by the main part of the song, a number of variable sequences that often incorporate snatches of song mimicked from other species of bird and various naturally occurring or man-made noises. The structure and simplicity of the sound mimicked is of greater importance than the frequency with which it occurs. In some instances, a wild starling has been observed to mimic a sound it has heard only once. Each sound clip is repeated several times before the bird moves on to the next. After this variable section comes a number of types of repeated clicks followed by a final burst of high-frequency song, again formed of several types. Each bird has its own repertoire with more proficient birds having a range of up to 35 variable song types and as many as 14 types of clicks.</p><p>Males sing constantly as the breeding period approaches and perform less often once pairs have bonded. In the presence of a female, a male sometimes flies to his nest and sings from the entrance, apparently attempting to entice the female in. Older birds tend to have a wider repertoire than younger ones. Those males that engage in longer bouts of singing and that have wider repertoires attract mates earlier and have greater reproductive success than others. Females appear to prefer mates with more complex songs, perhaps because this indicates greater experience or longevity. Having a complex song is also useful in defending a territory and deterring less experienced males from encroaching.</p><p>Singing also occurs outside the breeding season, taking place throughout the year apart from the moulting period. The songsters are more commonly male although females also sing on occasion. The function of such out-of-season song is poorly understood. Eleven other types of call have been described including a flock call, threat call, attack call, snarl call and copulation call. The alarm call is a harsh scream, and while foraging together common starlings squabble incessantly. They chatter while roosting and bathing, making a great deal of noise that can cause irritation to people living nearby. When a flock of common starlings is flying together, the synchronised movements of the birds' wings make a distinctive whooshing sound that can be heard hundreds of metres away.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Behaviour_and_ecology\">Behaviour and ecology</span></h2>\n\n<p>The common starling is a highly gregarious species, especially in autumn and winter. Although flock size is highly variable, huge, noisy flocks - murmurations - may form near roosts. These dense concentrations of birds are thought to be a defence against attacks by birds of prey such as peregrine falcons or Eurasian sparrowhawks. Flocks form a tight sphere-like formation in flight, frequently expanding and contracting and changing shape, seemingly without any sort of leader. Each common starling changes its course and speed as a result of the movement of its closest neighbours.</p><p>Very large roosts, up to 1.5\u00a0million birds, form in city centres, woodlands and reedbeds, causing problems with their droppings. These may accumulate up to 30\u00a0cm (12\u00a0in) deep, killing trees by their concentration of chemicals. In smaller amounts, the droppings act as a fertiliser, and therefore woodland managers may try to move roosts from one area of a wood to another to benefit from the soil enhancement and avoid large toxic deposits.</p><p>Flocks of more than a million common starlings may be observed just before sunset in spring in southwestern Jutland, Denmark over the seaward marshlands of T\u00f8nder and Esbjerg municipalities between T\u00f8nder and Ribe. They gather in March until northern Scandinavian birds leave for their breeding ranges by mid-April. Their swarm behaviour creates complex shapes silhouetted against the sky, a phenomenon known locally as <i>sort sol</i> (\"black sun\").\nFlocks of anything from five to fifty thousand common starlings form in areas of the UK just before sundown during mid-winter. These flocks are commonly called murmurations.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Feeding\">Feeding</span></h3>\n\n<p>The common starling is largely insectivorous and feeds on both pest and other arthropods. The food range includes spiders, crane flies, moths, mayflies, dragonflies, damsel flies, grasshoppers, earwigs, lacewings, caddisflies, flies, beetles, sawflies, bees, wasps and ants. Prey are consumed in both adult and larvae stages of development, and common starlings will also feed on earthworms, snails, small amphibians and lizards. While the consumption of invertebrates is necessary for successful breeding, common starlings are omnivorous and can also eat grains, seeds, fruits, nectar and food waste if the opportunity arises. The Sturnidae differ from most birds in that they cannot easily metabolise foods containing high levels of sucrose, although they can cope with other fruits such as grapes and cherries. The isolated Azores subspecies of the common starling eats the eggs of the endangered roseate tern. Measures are being introduced to reduce common starling populations by culling before the terns return to their breeding colonies in spring.</p>\n\n<p>There are several methods by which common starlings obtain their food but for the most part, they forage close to the ground, taking insects from the surface or just underneath. Generally, common starlings prefer foraging amongst short-cropped grasses and eat with grazing animals or perch on their backs, where they will also feed on the mammal's external parasites. Large flocks may engage in a practice known as \"roller-feeding\", where the birds at the back of the flock continually fly to the front where the feeding opportunities are best. The larger the flock, the nearer individuals are to one another while foraging. Flocks often feed in one place for some time, and return to previous successfully foraged sites.</p><p>There are three types of foraging behaviour observed in the common starling. \"Probing\" involves the bird plunging its beak into the ground randomly and repetitively until an insect has been found, and is often accompanied by bill gaping where the bird opens its beak in the soil to enlarge a hole. This behaviour, first described by Konrad Lorenz and given the German term <i>zirkeln</i>, is also used to create and widen holes in plastic garbage bags. It takes time for young common starlings to perfect this technique, and because of this the diet of young birds will often contain fewer insects. \"Hawking\" is the capture of flying insects directly from the air, and \"lunging\" is the less common technique of striking forward to catch a moving invertebrate on the ground. Earthworms are caught by pulling from soil. Common starlings that have periods without access to food, or have a reduction in the hours of light available for feeding, compensate by increasing their body mass by the deposition of fat.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Nesting\">Nesting</span></h3>\n\n<p>Unpaired males find a suitable cavity and begin to build nests in order to attract single females, often decorating the nest with ornaments such as flowers and fresh green material, which the female later disassembles upon accepting him as a mate. The amount of green material is not important, as long as some is present, but the presence of herbs in the decorative material appears to be significant in attracting a mate. The scent of plants such as yarrow acts as an olfactory attractant to females.</p><p>The males sing throughout much of the construction and even more so when a female approaches his nest. Following copulation, the male and female continue to build the nest. Nests may be in any type of hole, common locations include inside hollowed trees, buildings, tree stumps and man-made nest-boxes. <i>S. v. zetlandicus</i> typically breeds in crevices and holes in cliffs, a habitat only rarely used by the nominate form. Nests are typically made out of straw, dry grass and twigs with an inner lining made up of feathers, wool and soft leaves. Construction usually takes four or five days and may continue through incubation.</p><p>Common starlings are both monogamous and polygamous; although broods are generally brought up by one male and one female, occasionally the pair may have an extra helper. Pairs may be part of a colony, in which case several other nests may occupy the same or nearby trees. Males may mate with a second female while the first is still on the nest. The reproductive success of the bird is poorer in the second nest than it is in the primary nest and is better when the male remains monogamous.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Breeding\">Breeding</span></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Breeding takes place during the spring and summer. Following copulation, the female lays eggs on a daily basis over a period of several days. If an egg is lost during this time, she will lay another to replace it. There are normally four or five eggs that are ovoid in shape and pale blue or occasionally white, and they commonly have a glossy appearance. The colour of the eggs seems to have evolved through the relatively good visibility of blue at low light levels. The egg size is 26.5\u201334.5\u00a0mm (1.04\u20131.36\u00a0in) in length and 20.0\u201322.5\u00a0mm (0.79\u20130.89\u00a0in) in maximum diameter.</p><p>Incubation lasts thirteen days, although the last egg laid may take 24\u00a0hours longer than the first to hatch. Both parents share the responsibility of brooding the eggs, but the female spends more time incubating them than does the male, and is the only parent to do so at night when the male returns to the communal roost. The young are born blind and naked. They develop light fluffy down within seven days of hatching and can see within nine days. Once the chicks are able to regulate their body temperature, about six days after hatching, the adults largely cease removing droppings from the nest. Prior to that, the fouling would wet both the chicks' plumage and the nest material, thereby reducing their effectiveness as insulation and increasing the risk of chilling the hatchlings. Nestlings remain in the nest for three weeks, where they are fed continuously by both parents. Fledglings continue to be fed by their parents for another one or two weeks. A pair can raise up to three broods per year, frequently reusing and relining the same nest, although two broods is typical, or just one north of 48\u00b0N. Within two months, most juveniles will have moulted and gained their first basic plumage. They acquire their adult plumage the following year. As with other passerines, the nest is kept clean and the chicks' faecal sacs are removed by the adults.</p><p>Intraspecific brood parasites are common in common starling nests. Female \"floaters\" (unpaired females during the breeding season) present in colonies often lay eggs in another pair's nest. Fledglings have also been reported to invade their own or neighbouring nests and evict a new brood. Common starling nests have a 48% to 79% rate of successful fledging, although only 20% of nestlings survive to breeding age; the adult survival rate is closer to 60%. The average life span is about 2\u20133 years, with a longevity record of 22\u00a0yr 11\u00a0m.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Predators_and_parasites\">Predators and parasites</span></h2>\n<p>A majority of starling predators are avian. The typical response of starling groups is to take flight, with a common sight being undulating flocks of starling flying high in quick and agile patterns. Their abilities in flight are seldom matched by birds of prey. Adult common starlings are hunted by hawks such as the northern goshawk (<i>Accipiter gentilis</i>) and Eurasian sparrowhawk (<i>Accipiter nisus</i>), and falcons including the peregrine falcon (<i>Falco peregrinus</i>), Eurasian hobby (<i>Falco subbuteo</i>) and common kestrel (<i>Falco tinnunculus</i>). Slower raptors like black and red kites (<i>Milvus migrans &amp; milvus</i>), eastern imperial eagle (<i>Aquila heliaca</i>), common buzzard (<i>Buteo buteo</i>) and Australasian harrier (<i>Circus approximans</i>) tend to take the more easily caught fledglings or juveniles. While perched in groups by night, they can be vulnerable to owls, including the little owl (<i>Athene noctua</i>), long-eared owl (<i>Asio otus</i>), short-eared owl (<i>Asio flammeus</i>), barn owl (<i>Tyto alba</i>), tawny owl (<i>Strix aluco</i>) and Eurasian eagle-owl (<i>Bubo bubo</i>).</p><p>More than twenty species of hawk, owl and falcon are known to occasionally predate feral starlings in North America, though the most regular predators of adults are likely to be urban-living peregrine falcons or merlins (<i>Falco columbarius</i>). Common mynas (<i>Acridotheres tristis</i>) sometimes evict eggs, nestlings and adult common starlings from their nests, and the lesser honeyguide (<i>Indicator minor</i>), a brood parasite, uses the common starling as a host. Starlings are more commonly the culprits rather than victims of nest eviction however, especially towards other starlings and woodpeckers. Nests can be raided by mammals capable of climbing to them, such as stoats (<i>Mustela erminea</i>), raccoons (<i>Procyon lotor</i>) and squirrels (<i>Sciurus</i> spp.), and cats may catch the unwary.</p><p>Common starlings are hosts to a wide range of parasites. A survey of three hundred common starlings from six US states found that all had at least one type of parasite; 99% had external fleas, mites or ticks, and 95% carried internal parasites, mostly various types of worm. Blood-sucking species leave their host when it dies, but other external parasites stay on the corpse. A bird with a deformed bill was heavily infested with <i>Mallophaga</i> lice, presumably due to its inability to remove vermin.</p>\n\n<p>The hen flea (<i>Ceratophyllus gallinae</i>) is the most common flea in their nests. The small, pale house-sparrow flea <i>C. fringillae</i>, is also occasionally found there and probably arises from the habit of its main host of taking over the nests of other species. This flea does not occur in the US, even on house sparrows. Lice include <i>Menacanthus eurystemus</i>, <i>Brueelia nebulosa</i> and <i>Stumidoecus sturni</i>. Other arthropod parasites include <i>Ixodes</i> ticks and mites such as <i>Analgopsis passerinus</i>, <i>Boydaia stumi</i>, <i>Dermanyssus gallinae</i>, <i>Ornithonyssus bursa</i>, <i>O. sylviarum</i>, <i>Proctophyllodes</i> species, <i>Pteronyssoides truncatus</i> and <i>Trouessartia rosteri</i>. The hen mite <i>D. gallinae</i> is itself preyed upon by the predatory mite <i>Androlaelaps casalis</i>. The presence of this control on numbers of the parasitic species may explain why birds are prepared to reuse old nests.</p><p>Flying insects that parasitise common starlings include the louse-fly <i>Omithomya nigricornis</i> and the saprophagous fly <i>Camus hemapterus</i>. The latter species breaks off the feathers of its host and lives on the fats produced by growing plumage. Larvae of the moth <i>Hofmannophila pseudospretella</i> are nest scavengers, which feed on animal material such as faeces or dead nestlings. Protozoan blood parasites of the genus <i>Haemoproteus</i> have been found in common starlings, but a better known pest is the brilliant scarlet nematode <i>Syngamus trachea</i>. This worm moves from the lungs to the trachea and may cause its host to suffocate. In Britain, the rook and the common starling are the most infested wild birds. Other recorded internal parasites include the spiny-headed worm <i>Prosthorhynchus transverses</i>.</p><p>Common starlings may contract avian tuberculosis, avian malaria and retrovirus-induced lymphomas. Captive starlings often accumulate excess iron in the liver, a condition that can be prevented by adding black tea-leaves to the food.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Distribution_and_habitat\">Distribution and habitat</span></h2>\n<p>The global population of common starlings was estimated to be 310\u00a0million individuals in 2004, occupying a total area of 8,870,000\u00a0km<sup>2</sup> (3,420,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi). Widespread throughout the Northern Hemisphere, the bird is native to Eurasia and is found throughout Europe, northern Africa (from Morocco to Egypt), India (mainly in the north but regularly extending further south and extending into the Maldives) Nepal, the Middle East including Syria, Iran, and Iraq and north-western China.</p>\n\n<p>Common starlings in the south and west of Europe and south of latitude 40\u00b0N are mainly resident, although other populations migrate from regions where the winter is harsh, the ground frozen and food scarce. Large numbers of birds from northern Europe, Russia and Ukraine migrate south westwards or south eastwards. In the autumn, when immigrants are arriving from eastern Europe, many of Britain's common starlings are setting off for Iberia and North Africa. Other groups of birds are in passage across the country and the pathways of these different streams of bird may cross. Of the 15,000 birds ringed as nestlings in Merseyside, England, individuals have been recovered at various times of year as far afield as Norway, Sweden, Finland, Russia, Ukraine, Poland, Germany and the Low Countries. Small numbers of common starling have sporadically been observed in Japan and Hong Kong but it is unclear from where these birds originated. In North America, northern populations have developed a migration pattern, vacating much of Canada in winter. Birds in the east of the country move southwards, and those from further west winter in the southwest of the US.</p><p>Common starlings prefer urban or suburban areas where artificial structures and trees provide adequate nesting and roosting sites. Reedbeds are also favoured for roosting and the birds commonly feed in grassy areas such as farmland, grazing pastures, playing fields, golf courses and airfields where short grass makes foraging easy. They occasionally inhabit open forests and woodlands and are sometimes found in shrubby areas such as Australian heathland. Common starlings rarely inhabit dense, wet forests (i.e. rainforests or wet sclerophyll forests) but are found in coastal areas, where they nest and roost on cliffs and forage amongst seaweed. Their ability to adapt to a large variety of habitats has allowed them to disperse and establish themselves in diverse locations around the world resulting in a habitat range from coastal wetlands to alpine forests, from sea cliffs to mountain ranges 1,900\u00a0m (6,200\u00a0ft) above sea level.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Introduced_populations\">Introduced populations</span></h3>\n<p>The common starling has been introduced to and has successfully established itself in New Zealand, Australia, South Africa, North America, Fiji and several Caribbean islands. As a result, it has also been able to migrate to Thailand, Southeast Asia and New Guinea.</p>\n<h4><span id=\"South_America\">South America</span></h4>\n<p>Five individuals conveyed on a ship from England alighted near Lago de Maracaibo in Venezuela in November 1949, but subsequently vanished. In 1987, a small population of common starlings was observed nesting in gardens in the city of Buenos Aires. Since then, despite some initial attempts at eradication, the bird has been expanding its breeding range at an average rate of 7.5\u00a0km (4.7\u00a0mi) per year, keeping within 30\u00a0km (19\u00a0mi) of the Atlantic coast. In Argentina, the species makes use of a variety of natural and man-made nesting sites, particularly woodpecker holes.</p>\n<h4><span id=\"Australia\">Australia</span></h4>\n<p>The common starling was introduced to Australia to consume insect pests of farm crops. Early settlers looked forward to their arrival, believing that common starlings were also important for the pollination of flax, a major agricultural product. Nest-boxes for the newly released birds were placed on farms and near crops. The common starling was introduced to Melbourne in 1857 and Sydney two decades later. By the 1880s, established populations were present in the southeast of the country thanks to the work of acclimatisation committees. By the 1920s, common starlings were widespread throughout Victoria, Queensland and New South Wales, but by then they were considered to be pests. Although common starlings were first sighted in Albany, Western Australia in 1917, they have been largely prevented from spreading to the state. The wide and arid Nullarbor Plain provides a natural barrier and control measures have been adopted that have killed 55,000 birds over three decades. The common starling has also colonised Kangaroo Island, Lord Howe Island, Norfolk Island and Tasmania.</p>\n<h4><span id=\"New_Zealand\">New Zealand</span></h4>\n<p>The early settlers in New Zealand cleared the bush and found their newly planted crops were invaded by hordes of caterpillars and other insects deprived of their previous food sources. Native birds were not habituated to living in close proximity to man so the common starling was introduced from Europe along with the House Sparrow to control the pests. It was first brought over in 1862 by the Nelson Acclimatisation Society and other introductions followed. The birds soon became established and are now found all over the country including the subtropical Kermadec Islands to the north and the equally distant Macquarie Island far to the south.</p>\n<h4><span id=\"North_America\">North America</span></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>After two failed attempts, about 60 common starlings were released in 1890 into New York's Central Park by Eugene Schieffelin. He was president of the American Acclimatization Society, which reportedly tried to introduce every bird species mentioned in the works of William Shakespeare into North America, although this has been disputed. About the same date, the Portland Song Bird Club released 35 pairs of common starlings in Portland, Oregon. These birds became established but disappeared around 1902. Common starlings reappeared in the Pacific Northwest in the mid-1940s and these birds were probably descendants of the 1890 Central Park introduction. The original 60 birds have since swelled in number to 150\u00a0million, occupying an area extending from southern Canada and Alaska to Central America.</p>\n<h4><span id=\"Polynesia\">Polynesia</span></h4>\n<p>The common starling appears to have arrived in Fiji in 1925 on Ono-i-lau and Vatoa islands. It may have colonised from New Zealand via Raoul in the Kermadec Islands where it is abundant, that group being roughly equidistant between New Zealand and Fiji. Its spread in Fiji has been limited, and there are doubts about the population's viability. Tonga was colonised at about the same date and the birds there have been slowly spreading north through the group.</p>\n<h4><span id=\"South_Africa\">South Africa</span></h4>\n<p>In South Africa, the common starling was introduced in 1897 by Cecil Rhodes. It spread slowly, and by 1954, had reached Clanwilliam and Port Elizabeth. It is now common in the southern Cape region, thinning out northwards to the Johannesburg area. It is present in the Western Cape, the Eastern Cape and the Free State provinces of South Africa and lowland Lesotho, with occasional sightings in KwaZulu-Natal, Gauteng and around the town of Oranjemund in Namibia. In Southern Africa populations appear to be resident and the bird is strongly associated with man and anthropogenic habitats. It favours irrigated land and is absent from regions where the ground is baked so dry that it cannot probe for insects. It may compete with native birds for crevice nesting sites but the indigenous species are probably more disadvantaged by destruction of their natural habitat than they are by inter-specific competition. It breeds from September to December and outside the breeding season may congregate in large flocks, often roosting in reedbeds. It is the most common bird species in urban and agricultural areas.</p>\n<h4><span id=\"West_Indies\">West Indies</span></h4>\n<p>In 1901, the inhabitants of Saint Kitts petitioned the Colonial Secretary for a \u2033government grant of starlings to exterminate\u2033 an outbreak of grasshoppers which was causing enormous damage to their crops. The common starling was introduced to Jamaica in 1903, and the Bahamas and Cuba were colonised naturally from the US. This bird is fairly common but local in Jamaica, Grand Bahama and Bimini, and is rare in the rest of the Bahamas, eastern Cuba, the Cayman Islands, Puerto Rico and St. Croix.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Status\">Status</span></h2>\n<p>The global population of the common starling is estimated to be more than 310\u00a0million individuals and its numbers are not thought to be declining significantly, so the bird is classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as being of least concern. It had shown a marked increase in numbers throughout Europe from the 19th century to around the 1950s and 60s. In about 1830, <i>S. v. vulgaris</i> expanded its range in the British Isles, spreading into Ireland and areas of Scotland where it had formerly been absent, although <i>S. v. zetlandicus</i> was already present in Shetland and the Outer Hebrides. The common starling has bred in northern Sweden from 1850 and in Iceland from 1935. The breeding range spread through southern France to northeastern Spain, and there were other range expansions particularly in Italy, Austria and Finland. It started breeding in Iberia in 1960, while the spotless starling's range had been expanding northward since the 1950s. The low rate of advance, about 4.7\u00a0km (2.9\u00a0mi) per year for both species, is due to the suboptimal mountain and woodland terrain. Expansion has since slowed even further due to direct competition between the two similar species where they overlap in southwestern France and northwestern Spain.</p><p>Major declines in populations have been observed from 1980 onward in Sweden, Finland, northern Russia (Karelia) and the Baltic States, and smaller declines in much of the rest of northern and central Europe. The bird has been adversely affected in these areas by intensive agriculture, and in several countries it has been red-listed due to population declines of more than 50%. Numbers dwindled in the United Kingdom by more than 80% between 1966 and 2004; although populations in some areas such as Northern Ireland were stable or even increased, those in other areas, mainly England, declined even more sharply. The overall decline seems to be due to the low survival rate of young birds, which may be caused by changes in agricultural practices. The intensive farming methods used in northern Europe mean there is less pasture and meadow habitat available, and the supply of grassland invertebrates needed for the nestlings to thrive is correspondingly reduced.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Relationship_with_humans\">Relationship with humans</span></h2>\n<h3><span id=\"Benefits_and_problems\">Benefits and problems</span></h3>\n\n\n<p>Since common starlings eat insect pests such as wireworms, they are considered beneficial in northern Eurasia, and this was one of the reasons given for introducing the birds elsewhere. Around 25\u00a0million nest boxes were erected for this species in the former Soviet Union, and common starlings were found to be effective in controlling the grass grub <i>Costelytra zealandica</i> in New Zealand. The original Australian introduction was facilitated by the provision of nest boxes to help this mainly insectivorous bird to breed successfully, and even in the US, where this is a pest species, the Department of Agriculture acknowledges that vast numbers of insects are consumed by common starlings.</p><p>Common starlings introduced to areas such as Australia or North America, where other members of the genus are absent, may affect native species through competition for nest holes. In North America, chickadees, nuthatches, woodpeckers, purple martins and other swallows may be affected. In Australia, competitors for nesting sites include the crimson and eastern rosellas. For its role in the decline of local native species and the damages to agriculture, the common starling has been included in the IUCN List of the world's 100 worst invasive species.</p><p>Common starlings can eat and damage fruit in orchards such as grapes, peaches, olives, currants and tomatoes or dig up newly sown grain and sprouting crops. They may also eat animal feed and distribute seeds through their droppings. In eastern Australia, weeds like bridal creeper, blackberry and boneseed are thought to have been spread by common starlings. Agricultural damage in the US is estimated as costing about US$800\u00a0million annually. This bird is not considered to be as damaging to agriculture in South Africa as it is in the United States.</p><p>The large size of flocks can also cause problems. Common starlings may be sucked into aircraft jet engines, one of the worst instances of this being an incident in Boston in 1960, when sixty-two people died after a turboprop airliner flew into a flock and plummeted into the sea at Winthrop Harbor.</p><p>Starlings' droppings can contain the fungus <i>Histoplasma capsulatum</i>, the cause of histoplasmosis in humans. At roosting sites this fungus can thrive in accumulated droppings. There are a number of other infectious diseases that can potentially be transmitted by common starlings to humans, although the potential for the birds to spread infections may have been exaggerated.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Control\">Control</span></h3>\n<p>Because of the damage they do, there have been attempts to control the numbers of both native and introduced populations of common starlings. Within the natural breeding range, this may be affected by legislation. For example, in Spain, this is a species hunted commercially as a food item, and has a closed season, whereas in France, it is classed as a pest, and the season in which it may be killed covers the greater part of the year. In Great Britain, Starlings are protected under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, which makes it \"illegal to intentionally kill, injure or take a starling, or to take, damage or destroy an active nest or its contents\". The Wildlife Order in Northern Ireland allows, with a general licence, \"an authorised person to control starlings to prevent serious damage to agriculture or preserve public health and safety\". This species is migratory, so birds involved in control measures may have come from a wide area and breeding populations may not be greatly affected. In Europe, the varying legislation and mobile populations mean that control attempts may have limited long-term results. Non-lethal techniques such as scaring with visual or auditory devices have only a temporary effect in any case.</p><p>Huge urban roosts in cities can create problems due to the noise and mess made and the smell of the droppings. In 1949, so many birds landed on the clock hands of London's Big Ben that it stopped, leading to unsuccessful attempts to disrupt the roosts with netting, repellent chemical on the ledges and broadcasts of common starling alarm calls. An entire episode of <i>The Goon Show</i> in 1954 was a parody of the futile efforts to disrupt the large common starling roosts in central London.</p>\n\n<p>Where it is introduced, the common starling is unprotected by legislation, and extensive control plans may be initiated. Common starlings can be prevented from using nest boxes by ensuring that the access holes are smaller than the 1.5\u00a0in (38\u00a0mm) diameter they need, and the removal of perches discourages them from visiting bird feeders.</p><p>Western Australia banned the import of common starlings in 1895. New flocks arriving from the east are routinely shot, while the less cautious juveniles are trapped and netted. New methods are being developed, such as tagging one bird and tracking it back to establish where other members of the flock roost. Another technique is to analyse the DNA of Australian common starling populations to track where the migration from eastern to western Australia is occurring so that better preventive strategies can be used. By 2009, only 300 common starlings were left in Western Australia, and the state committed a further A$400,000 in that year to continue the eradication programme.</p><p>In the United States, common starlings are exempt from the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, which prohibits the taking or killing of migratory birds. No permit is required to remove nests and eggs or kill juveniles or adults. Research was undertaken in 1966 to identify a suitable avicide that would both kill common starlings and would readily be eaten by them. It also needed to be of low toxicity to mammals and not likely to cause the death of pets that ate dead birds. The chemical that best fitted these criteria was DRC-1339, now marketed as Starlicide. In 2008, the United States government poisoned, shot or trapped 1.7\u00a0million birds, the largest number of any nuisance species to be culled. In 2005, the population in the United States was estimated at 140\u00a0million birds, around 45% of the global total of 310\u00a0million.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"In_science_and_culture\">In science and culture</span></h3>\n\n<p>Common starlings may be kept as pets or as laboratory animals. Austrian ethologist Konrad Lorenz wrote of them in his book <i>King Solomon's Ring</i> as \"the poor man's dog\" and \"something to love\", because nestlings are easily obtained from the wild and after careful hand rearing they are straightforward to look after. They adapt well to captivity, and thrive on a diet of standard bird feed and mealworms. Several birds may be kept in the same cage, and their inquisitiveness makes them easy to train or study. The only disadvantages are their messy and indiscriminate defecation habits and the need to take precautions against diseases that may be transmitted to humans. As a laboratory bird, the common starling is second in numbers only to the domestic pigeon.</p><p>The common starling's gift for mimicry has long been recognised. In the medieval Welsh <i>Mabinogion</i>, Branwen tamed a common starling, \"taught it words\", and sent it across the Irish Sea with a message to her brothers, Bran and Manawydan, who then sailed from Wales to Ireland to rescue her. Pliny the Elder claimed that these birds could be taught to speak whole sentences in Latin and Greek, and in <i>Henry IV</i>, William Shakespeare had Hotspur declare \"The king forbade my tongue to speak of Mortimer. But I will find him when he is asleep, and in his ear I'll holler 'Mortimer!' Nay I'll have a starling shall be taught to speak nothing but Mortimer, and give it to him to keep his anger still in motion.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>Mozart had a pet common starling which could sing part of his Piano Concerto in G Major (KV. 453). He had bought it from a shop after hearing it sing a phrase from a work he wrote six weeks previously, which had not yet been performed in public. He became very attached to the bird and arranged an elaborate funeral for it when it died three years later. It has been suggested that his <i>A Musical Joke</i> (K. 522) might be written in the comical, inconsequential style of a starling's vocalisation. Other people who have owned common starlings report how adept they are at picking up phrases and expressions. The words have no meaning for the starling, so they often mix them up or use them on what to humans are inappropriate occasions in their songs. Their ability at mimicry is so great that strangers have looked in vain for the human they think they have just heard speak.</p><p>Common starlings are trapped for food in some Mediterranean countries. The meat is tough and of low quality, so it is casseroled or made into p\u00e2t\u00e9. One recipe said it should be stewed \"until tender, however long that may be\". Even when correctly prepared, it may still be seen as an acquired taste.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Notes\">Notes</span></h2>\n\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n\n<h2><span id=\"Cited_texts\">Cited texts</span></h2>\n<ul><li><cite id=\"CITEREFArlott2010\" class=\"citation book\">Arlott, Norman (2010). <i>Birds of the West Indies</i>.

        "details": "<p class=\"mw-empty-elt\">\n</p>\n<p>The <b>common swift</b> (<i>Apus apus</i>) is a medium-sized bird, superficially similar to the barn swallow or house martin but somewhat larger, though not stemming from those passerine species, being in the order Apodiformes. The resemblances between the groups are due to convergent evolution, reflecting similar contextual development. The swifts' nearest relatives are the New World hummingbirds and the Southeast Asian treeswifts.\n</p><p>Its scientific name <i>Apus</i> is Latin for a swift, thought by the ancients to be a type of swallow with no feet (from Ancient Greek \u03b1, <i>a</i>, \"without\", and \u03c0\u03bf\u03cd\u03c2, <i>pous</i>, \"foot\").</p><p>Swifts have very short legs which they use primarily for clinging to vertical surfaces (hence the German name <i>Mauersegler</i>, literally meaning \"wall-glider\"). They never settle voluntarily on the ground, where they would be vulnerable to accidents and predation, and non-breeding individuals may spend up to ten months in continuous flight.</p>\n\n\n<h2><span id=\"Taxonomy\">Taxonomy</span></h2>\n<p>The common swift was one of the many species described by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his <i>Systema Naturae</i>. He introduced the binomial name <i>Hirundo apus</i>. The current genus <i>Apus</i> was erected by the Italian naturalist Giovanni Antonio Scopoli in 1777 based on tautonymy. The word <i>apus</i> is the Latin word for a swift. It is derived from the Ancient Greek \u03b1, <i>a</i>, \"without\", and \u03c0\u03bf\u03cd\u03c2, <i>pous</i>, \"foot\", based on the belief that these birds were a form of swallow that lacked feet.</p><p>The predecessor of the Central European subspecies which lived during the last ice age has been described as <i>Apus apus palapus</i>.\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Description\">Description</span></h2>\n<p>Common swifts are 16\u201317\u00a0cm (6.3\u20136.7\u00a0in) long with a wingspan of 38\u201340\u00a0cm (15\u201316\u00a0in) and entirely blackish-brown except for a small white or pale grey patch on their chins which is not visible from a distance. They have a short forked tail and very long swept-back wings that resemble a crescent or a boomerang.\n</p><p>Their call is a loud scream in two different tone pitches, the higher of which issues from the female. They often form 'screaming parties' during summer evenings, when 10\u201320 swifts will gather in flight around their nesting area, calling out and being answered by nesting swifts. Larger \"screaming parties\" are formed at higher altitudes, especially late in the breeding season. The purpose of these parties is uncertain, but may include ascending to sleep on the wing, while still breeding adults tend to spend the night in the nest. Tracking swifts at their breeding colonies using radar has revealed that individuals often occur in flocks during dawn ascent and dawn descent but not during dawn ascent and dusk descent, suggesting that this flocking benefits the swifts via cue acquisition and information exchange between individuals or through extending social behaviour. </p>\n<h2><span id=\"Behaviour\">Behaviour</span></h2>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Swifts may nest in former woodpecker tree burrows found in ancient forests, such as some 600 reported nesting in the Bia\u0142owie\u017ca Forest of North Eastern Poland, or the small colony found in a combination of woodpecker holes and tree nestboxes on the RSPB's reserve at the Caledonian Forest in Abernethy, Scotland. While tree holes and cliffs may have comprised their historic nesting resource, the almost complete removal of ancient forest from their nesting range has resulted in adaptation to man-made sites. Swifts build their nests of air-borne material caught in flight, bonded with their saliva, in suitable buildings hollows, such as under tiles, in gaps beneath window sills, and most typically under eaves and within gables.\n</p><p>Swifts form pairs that may couple for years, and often return to the same nesting site and partner year after year, repairing degradation suffered in their 40-week migratory absence. Insects such as clothes moths, carpet and larder beetles may consume all but the most indigestible nest elements, typically feather shafts.\n</p><p>Young nesting swifts are able to survive for a few days without food by dropping their body temperature and metabolic rate, entering a torpid state.\n</p><p>Except when nesting, swifts spend their lives in the air, living on the insects caught in flight; they drink, feed, and often mate and sleep on the wing. Some individuals go 10 months without landing. No other bird spends as much of its life in flight. Their maximum horizontal flying speed is 111.6\u00a0km/h. Over a lifetime they can cover millions of kilometers.</p><p>Feeding parties can be very large in insect-rich areas, such as wetlands. Reports of as many as 2000 swifts feeding over flooded gravel pits, lakes and marshy river deltas are not uncommon, and may represent an ingress of swifts from within as much as a 100\u00a0km (62\u00a0mi) radius; swifts nesting in Western Scotland are thought to venture to Lough Neagh in Northern Ireland to feed on the abundant and nutritious \"Lough Neagh Fly\".\n</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Breeding\">Breeding</span></h3>\n<p>Common swifts nest in a wider variety of sites than any other species of <i>Apus</i>. Swifts usually nest in buildings but they can also be found nesting in holes in trees, cliffs and crevices, and even in nestboxes. Swifts usually enter their nesting holes with direct flight, and take-off is characterized by an initial free-fall. Empty cavities are shallower than those with nests, and the entry size is smaller in the former than in the latter.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Migration\">Migration</span></h3>\n\n<p>Common swifts are migratory. Their summer breeding range runs from Portugal and Ireland in the West across to China and Siberia in the East. They breed as far south as Northern Africa (in Morocco and Algeria), with a presence in the Middle East in Israel, Lebanon and Syria, the Near East across Turkey, and the whole of Europe as far north as Norway, Finland, and most of sub-Arctic Russia. Swifts migrate to Africa by a variety of routes, ending up in Equatorial and Sub-Equatorial Africa, excluding the Cape. Common swifts do not breed on the Indian Subcontinent.\n</p><p>Subjects of a geolocator tracking study demonstrated that swifts breeding in Sweden winter in the Congo region of Africa. Swifts spend three to three-and-a-half months in Africa and a similar time breeding - the rest is spent on the wing, flying home or away. Unsuccessful breeders, fledglings, and sexually immature year-old birds are the first to leave their breeding area. Breeding males follow next, and finally the breeding females. The breeding females stay longer in the nest to rebuild their fat reserves. The time of departure is often determined by the light cycle, and begins at the first day of less than 17 hours light. For this reason, birds further north, for instance in Finland, leave later in the second half of August. These latecomers are rushed through the quickly shortening days in Central Europe and are barely seen by bird watchers.\n</p><p>The prevailing direction of travel through Central Europe is south-by-southwest, and so the Alps do not present a barrier. In bad weather, the swifts follow rivers, because they can find a better food supply there. The population of Western and Central Europe traverses the Iberian peninsula and northwestern Africa. Swifts from Russia and southeastern Europe made a long journey over the eastern part of the Mediterranean. It is unclear where the two groups meet. The western group of swifts mostly follow the Atlantic coastline of Africa\u2014otherwise they would have to cross the Sahara. Once they arrive at the humid savanna, they turn southeast to arrive at their winter feeding grounds. During the summer in Africa, there is a great bounty of insects for the swifts, since the region lies in the Intertropical Convergence Zone. The swifts have a nearly unbroken presence in the sky.\n</p><p>A few swifts, usually some of the sexually immature one year olds, remain in Africa. The majority fly northwards through Africa, then turn east towards their destinations. The birds use low pressure fronts during their spring migrations to exploit the southwestern flow of warm air, and on the return trip, ride northeastern winds on the back of the low pressure fronts.\n</p><p>In Central Europe, the swifts return in the second half of April and the first third of May, and like to stay in lowlands and near water rather than in high places. In more northerly regions, the swifts arrive later. The weather along the journey has an enormous influence on the arrival date, so in one region the swifts may come back at varying times year to year.\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Differences_between_swifts_and_swallows\">Differences between swifts and swallows</span></h2>\n<p>The barn swallow and house martin hunt for airborne insects in a manner similar to that of the slightly larger swift, and occasionally mixed groups of the species form. The most noticeable differences between the three types are:\n</p>\n<ul><li>The shrill scream of the swift distinguishes itself from the more inconspicuous babbling of the swallow.</li>\n<li>The narrow sickle-shaped wings of the swift are longer than its body, and its silhouette in the air resembles an anchor.</li>\n<li>The swift's wingbeats are deep and quick, and the swift glides for longer.

Popular for its nest made of leaves \"sewn\" together and immortalized by Rudyard Kipling as <i>Darzee</i> in his <i>Jungle Book</i>, it is a common resident in urban gardens. Although shy birds that are usually hidden within vegetation, their loud calls are familiar and give away their presence. They are distinctive in having a long upright tail, greenish upper body plumage and rust coloured forehead and crown. This passerine bird is typically found in open farmland, scrub, forest edges and gardens.  Tailorbirds get their name from the way their nest is constructed. The edges of a large leaf are pierced and sewn together with plant fibre or spider silk to make a cradle in which the actual nest is built. \n</p>\n\n\n<h2><span id=\"Taxonomy_and_systematics\">Taxonomy and systematics</span></h2>\n<p>The scientific name <i>sutorius</i> means \"cobbler\" rather than \"tailor\" while <i>Orthotomus</i> means \"straight-cutting\".</p><p>The species was earlier placed in the family Sylviidae but more recent molecular studies place the species within the family Cisticolidae, along with <i>Prinia</i> and <i>Cisticola</i>.</p><p>A number of subspecies are recognized within its widespread range in South Asia and Southeast Asia. The nominate race is from the lowlands of Sri Lanka. Race <i>O. s. fernandonis</i> is found in the highlands of Sri Lanka. Neighbouring India has <i>O.s. guzuratus</i> in the peninsula and west to Pakistan while towards the north <i>O. s. patia</i> is found in the Terai of Nepal along the Himalayan foothills until Myanmar. A small population of <i>O. s. patia</i> is also found in the northern Eastern Ghats (Wangasara). The hills of northeastern India have <i>O. s. luteus</i>. In Southeast Asia <i>O. s. inexpectatus</i> and <i>O. s. maculicollis</i> are found in Thailand, Laos and Vietnam, Malaysia, Cambodia and Vietnam. South east China, including the island of Hainan, and Tonkin in Vietnam have <i>O. s. longicauda</i> while <i>O. s. edela</i> is found on Java.\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Description\">Description</span></h2>\n<p>The common tailorbird is a brightly coloured bird, with bright green upperparts and creamy underparts. They range in size from 10 to 14 centimetres (3.9 to 5.5\u00a0in) and weigh 6 to 10 grams (0.21 to 0.35\u00a0oz). They have short rounded wings, a long tail, strong legs and a sharp bill with curved tip to the upper mandible. They are wren-like with a long upright tail that is often moved around. The crown is rufous and the upperparts are predominantly olive green. The underside is creamy white. The sexes are identical, except that the male has long central tail feathers in the breeding season, although the reliability of sexing data accompanying museum specimens used in determining this sexual dimorphism has been questioned. Young birds are duller. When calling, the dark patches on the sides of the neck become visible. These are due to the dark pigmented and bare skin that are present in both sexes and sometimes give the appearance of a dark gorget.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Behaviour_and_ecology\">Behaviour and ecology</span></h2>\n\n<p>Like most warblers, the common tailorbird is insectivorous. The song is a loud <i>cheeup-cheeup-cheeup</i> with variations across the populations. The disyllabic calls are repeated often. Tailorbirds are found singly or in pairs, usually low in the undergrowth or trees, sometimes hopping on the ground. They forage for insects and have been known to feed on a range of beetles and bugs. They are attracted to insects at flowers and are known to favour the inflorescences of mango. They also visit flowers such as those of <i>Bombax</i>, <i>Salmalia</i> for nectar and are sometimes covered in pollen, giving them a golden-headed appearance.</p><p>The birds roost alone during the non-breeding season but may roost side-by-side during the breeding season, sometimes with the newly fledged juvenile sandwiched between the adults. The roost sites chosen are thin twigs on trees with cover above them and were often close to human habitation and lights.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Breeding\">Breeding</span></h3>\n\n<p>The breeding season is March to December peaking from June to August in India, coinciding with the wet season. In Sri Lanka the main breeding periods are March to May and August to September, although they can breed throughout the year.</p><p>Although the name is derived from their nest construction habit, the nest is not unique and is also found in many <i>Prinia</i> warblers. The nest is a deep cup, lined with soft materials and placed in thick foliage and the leaves holding the nest have the upper surfaces outwards making it difficult to spot. The punctures made on the edge of the leaves are minute and do not cause browning of the leaves, further aiding camouflage. The nest lining of a nest in Sri Lanka that was studied by Casey Wood was found to be lined with lint from <i>Euphorbia</i>, <i>Ceiba pentandra</i> and <i>Bombax malabaricum</i> species. Jerdon wrote that the bird made knots, however no knots are used. Wood classified the processes used by the tailorbird in nest as sewing, rivetting, lacing and matting. In some cases the nest is made from a single large leaf, the margins of which are rivetted together. Sometimes the fibres from one rivet are extended into an adjoining puncture and appearing more like sewing. The stitch is made by piercing two leaves and drawing fibre through them. The fibres fluff out on the outside and in effect they are more like rivets. There are many variations in the nest and some may altogether lack the cradle of leaves. One observer noted that the birds did not utilize cotton that was made available while another observer, Edward Hamilton Aitken, was able to induce them to use artificially supplied cotton. The usual clutch is three eggs.</p><p>The incubation period is about 12 days. Both male and female feed the young. Mortality of eggs and chicks is high due to predation by rodents, cats, crow-pheasants, lizards and other predators. The young birds fledge in about 14 days. The female alone incubates according to some sources, while others suggest that both sexes incubate; however, both parents take part in feeding and sanitation. The males are said to feed the incubating female. An unusual case of a pair of tailorbirds adopting chicks in an artificially translocated nest belonging to a different pair has been recorded. Nests are sometimes parasitized by the Plaintive Cuckoo (<i>Cacomantis merulinus</i>).</p>\n<h2><span id=\"In_culture\">In culture</span></h2>\n\n<p>\"Rikki-Tikki-Tavi\", one of Rudyard Kipling's <i>Jungle Book</i> stories, includes a tailorbird couple, <i>Darzee</i> (which means \"tailor\" in Urdu) and his wife, as two of the key characters. Darzee's wife is said to have feigned injury, but this behaviour is unknown in this species. A classic book of children's folk tales in Bengali by Upendrakishore Ray is titled \"Tuntunir Boi\", after the local name for the species, <i>tuntuni</i>.</p>\n<ul class=\"gallery mw-gallery-packed\"><li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 124.66666666667px\">\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 182.66666666667px\">\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 177.33333333333px\">\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 166px\">\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155.33333333333px\">\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 162px\">\n</ul><h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n\n<h2><span id=\"Other_sources\">Other sources</span></h2>\n<ul><li><cite id=\"CITEREFSen,_S.N.1947\" class=\"citation journal\">Sen, S.N.

        "details": "<p class=\"mw-empty-elt\">\n</p>\n<p>The <b>common tern</b> (<i>Sterna hirundo</i>) is a seabird in the family Laridae. This bird has a circumpolar distribution, its four subspecies breeding in temperate and subarctic regions of Europe, Asia and North America. It is strongly migratory, wintering in coastal tropical and subtropical regions. Breeding adults have light grey upperparts, white to very light grey underparts, a black cap, orange-red legs, and a narrow pointed bill. Depending on the subspecies, the bill may be mostly red with a black tip or all black. There are a number of similar species, including the partly sympatric Arctic tern, which can be separated on plumage details, leg and bill colour, or vocalisations.\n</p><p>Breeding in a wider range of habitats than any of its relatives, the common tern nests on any flat, poorly vegetated surface close to water, including beaches and islands, and it readily adapts to artificial substrates such as floating rafts. The nest may be a bare scrape in sand or gravel, but it is often lined or edged with whatever debris is available. Up to three eggs may be laid, their dull colours and blotchy patterns providing camouflage on the open beach. Incubation is by both sexes, and the eggs hatch in around 21\u201322 days, longer if the colony is disturbed by predators. The downy chicks fledge in 22\u201328\u00a0days. Like most terns, this species feeds by plunge-diving for fish, either in the sea or in freshwater, but molluscs, crustaceans and other invertebrate prey may form a significant part of the diet in some areas.\n</p><p>Eggs and young are vulnerable to predation by mammals such as rats and American mink, and large birds including gulls, owls and herons. Common terns may be infected by lice, parasitic worms, and mites, although blood parasites appear to be rare. Its large population and huge breeding range mean that this species is classed as being of least concern, although numbers in North America have declined sharply in recent decades. Despite international legislation protecting the common tern, in some areas populations are threatened by habitat loss, pollution or the disturbance of breeding colonies.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span id=\"Taxonomy\">Taxonomy</span></h2>\n<p>The terns are small to medium-sized seabirds closely related to the gulls, skimmers and skuas. They are gull-like in appearance, but typically have a lighter build, long pointed wings (which give them a fast, buoyant flight), a deeply forked tail, slender legs, and webbed feet. Most species are grey above and white below, and have a black cap which is reduced or flecked with white in the non-breeding season.</p><p>The common tern's closest relatives appear to be the Antarctic tern, followed by the Eurasian Arctic and roseate terns. Genetic evidence suggests that the common tern may have diverged from an ancestral stock earlier than its relatives. No fossils are known from North America, and those claimed in Europe are of uncertain age and species.</p><p>The common tern was first described by Linnaeus in his <i>Systema Naturae</i> in 1758 under its current scientific name, <i>Sterna hirundo</i>. The word \"stearn\" was used in Old English and a similar word was used by the Frisians for tern. \"Stearn\" appears in the poem <i>The Seafarer</i>, written around 1000 AD. Linnaeus adopted this word for the genus name <i>Sterna</i>. The Latin for swallow is \"hirundo\" and refers here to the tern's superficial likeness to that unrelated bird, which has a similar light build and long forked tail. This resemblance also leads to the informal name \"sea swallow\", recorded from at least the seventeenth century. The Scots names <i>picktarnie</i>, <i>tarrock</i> and their many variants are also believed to be onomatopoeic, derived from the distinctive call. Due to the difficulty in distinguishing the two species, all the informal common names are shared with the Arctic tern.</p><p>Four subspecies of the common tern are generally recognized, although <i>S.\u00a0h.\u00a0minussensis</i> is sometimes considered to be an intergrade between <i>S.\u00a0h.\u00a0hirundo</i> and <i>S.\u00a0h.\u00a0longipennis</i>.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Description\">Description</span></h2>\n\n\n<p>The nominate subspecies of the common tern is 31\u201335\u00a0cm (12\u201314\u00a0in) long, including a 6\u20139\u00a0cm (2.4\u20133.5\u00a0in) fork in the tail, with a 77\u201398\u00a0cm (30\u201339\u00a0in) wingspan. It weighs 110\u2013141\u00a0g (3.9\u20135.0\u00a0oz). Breeding adults have pale grey upperparts, very pale grey underparts, a black cap, orange-red legs, and a narrow pointed bill that can be mostly red with a black tip, or all black, depending on the subspecies. The common tern's upperwings are pale grey, but as the summer wears on, the dark feather shafts of the outer flight feathers become exposed, and a grey wedge appears on the wings. The rump and tail are white, and on a standing bird the long tail extends no further than the folded wingtips, unlike the Arctic and roseate terns in which the tail protrudes beyond the wings. There are no significant differences between the sexes. In non-breeding adults the forehead and underparts become white, the bill is all black or black with a red base, and the legs are dark red or black. The upperwings have an obvious dark area at the front edge of the wing, the carpal bar. Terns that have not bred successfully may start moulting into non-breeding adult plumage from June, but late July is more typical, with the moult suspended during migration. There is also some geographical variation, Californian birds often being in non-breeding plumage during migration.</p><p>Juvenile common terns have pale grey upperwings with a dark carpal bar. The crown and nape are brown, and the forehead is ginger, wearing to white by autumn. The upperparts are ginger with brown and white scaling, and the tail lacks the adult's long outer feathers. Birds in their first post-juvenile plumage, which normally remain in their wintering areas, resemble the non-breeding adult, but have a duskier crown, dark carpal bar, and often very worn plumage. By their second year, most young terns are either indistinguishable from adults, or show only minor differences such as a darker bill or white forehead.</p><p>The common tern is an agile flyer, capable of rapid turns and swoops, hovering, and vertical take-off. When commuting with fish, it flies close to the surface in a strong head wind, but 10\u201330\u00a0m (33\u201398\u00a0ft) above the water in a following wind. Unless migrating, normally it stays below 100\u00a0m (330\u00a0ft), and averages 30\u00a0km/h (19\u00a0mph) in the absence of a tail wind. Its average flight speed during the nocturnal migration flight is 43\u201354\u00a0km/h (27\u201334\u00a0mph) at a height of 1,000\u20133,000\u00a0m (3,300\u20139,800\u00a0ft).</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Moult\">Moult</span></h3>\n\n<p>The juvenile starts moulting into adult plumage in its first October; the head, tail and body plumage is replaced first, mostly by February, then the wing feathers. The primaries are replaced in stages; the innermost feathers moult first, then replacement is suspended during the southern winter (birds of this age staying in their wintering areas) and recommences in the autumn. In May to June of the second year a similar moult sequence starts, with a pause during primary moult for birds that return north, but not for those that stay in the winter quarters. A major moult to adult breeding plumage occurs in the next February to June, between 40\u201390% of feathers being replaced. Old primary feathers wear away to reveal the blackish barbs beneath. The moult pattern means that the oldest feathers are those nearest the middle of the wing, so as the northern summer progresses, a dark wedge appears on the wing due to this feather ageing process.</p><p>Terns are unusual in the frequency in which they moult their primaries, which are replaced at least twice, occasionally three times in a year. The visible difference in feather age is accentuated in the greater ultraviolet reflectance of new primaries, and the freshness of the wing feathers is used by females in mate selection. Experienced females tend to accept mates which best show their fitness through the quality of their wing feathers. Rarely, a very early moult at the nesting colony may be linked to breeding failure, both the onset of moult and reproductive behaviour being linked to falling levels of the hormone prolactin.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Similar_species\">Similar species</span></h3>\n\n<p>There are several terns of a similar size and general appearance to the common tern. A traditionally difficult species to separate is the Arctic tern, and until the key characteristics were clarified, distant or flying birds of the two species were often jointly recorded as \"commic terns\". Although similar in size, the two terns differ in structure and flight. The common tern has a larger head, thicker neck, longer legs, and more triangular and stiffer wings than its relative, and has a more powerful, direct flight. The Arctic tern has greyer underparts than the common, which make its white cheeks more obvious, whereas the rump of the common tern can be greyish in non-breeding plumage, compared to the white of its relative. The common tern develops a dark wedge on the wings as the breeding season progresses, but the wings of Arctic stay white throughout the northern summer. All the flight feathers of the Arctic tern are translucent against a bright sky, only the four innermost wing feathers of the common tern share this property. The trailing edge of the outer flight feathers is a thin black line in the Arctic tern, but thicker and less defined in the common. The bill of an adult common tern is orange-red with a black tip, except in black-billed <i>S.\u00a0h.\u00a0longipennis</i>, and its legs are bright red, while both features are a darker red colour in the Arctic tern, which also lacks the black bill tip.</p><p>In the breeding areas, the roseate tern can be distinguished by its pale plumage, long, mainly black bill and very long tail feathers. The non-breeding plumage of roseate is pale above and white, sometimes pink-tinged, below. It retains the long tail streamers, and has a black bill. In flight, the roseate's heavier head and neck, long bill and faster, stiffer wingbeats are also characteristic. It feeds further out to sea than the common tern. In North America, the Forster's tern in breeding plumage is obviously larger than the common, with relatively short wings, a heavy head and thick bill, and long, strong legs; in all non-breeding plumages, its white head and dark eye patch make the American species unmistakable.</p><p>In the wintering regions, there are also confusion species, including the Antarctic tern of the southern oceans, the South American tern, the Australasian white-fronted tern and the white-cheeked tern of the Indian Ocean. Identification may be aided by the plumage differences due to \"opposite\" breeding seasons. The Antarctic tern is more sturdy than the common, with a heavier bill. In breeding condition, its dusky underparts and full black cap outline a white cheek stripe. In non-breeding plumages, it lacks, or has only an indistinct, carpal bar, and young birds show dark bars on the tertials, obvious on the closed wing and in flight. The South American tern is larger than the common, with a larger, more curved red bill, and has a smoother, more extensive black cap in non-breeding plumage. Like Antarctic, it lacks a strong carpal bar in non-breeding plumages, and it also shares the distinctive barring of the tertials in young birds. The white-fronted tern has a white forehead in breeding plumage, a heavier bill, and in non-breeding plumage is paler below than the common, with white underwings. The white-cheeked tern is smaller, has uniform grey upperparts, and in breeding pumage is darker above with whiter cheeks.</p><p>Juvenile common terns are easily separated from similar-aged birds of related species. They show extensive ginger colouration to the back, and have a pale base to the bill. Young Arctic terns have a grey back and black bill, and juvenile roseate terns have a distinctive scalloped \"saddle\". Hybrids between common and roseate terns have been recorded, particularly from the US, and the intermediate plumage and calls shown by these birds is a potential identification pitfall. Such birds may have more extensive black on the bill, but confirmation of mixed breeding may depend on the exact details of individual flight feathers.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Voice\">Voice</span></h3>\n<p>The common tern has a wide repertoire of calls, which have a lower pitch than the equivalent calls of Arctic terns. The most distinctive sound is the alarm <i>KEE-yah</i>, stressed on the first syllable, in contrast to the second-syllable stress of the Arctic tern. The alarm call doubles up as a warning to intruders, although serious threats evoke a <i>kyar</i>, given as a tern takes flight, and quietens the usually noisy colony while its residents assess the danger. A down-slurred <i>keeur</i> is given when an adult is approaching the nest while carrying a fish, and is possibly used for individual recognition (chicks emerge from hiding when they hear their parents giving this call). Another common call is a <i>kip</i> uttered during social contact. Other vocalizations include a <i>kakakakaka</i> when attacking intruders, and a staccato <i>kek-kek-kek</i> from fighting males.</p><p>Parents and chicks can locate one another by call, and siblings also recognise each other's vocalisations from about the twelfth day from hatching, which helps to keep the brood together.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Distribution_and_habitat\">Distribution and habitat</span></h2>\n\n<p>Most populations of the common tern are strongly migratory, wintering south of their temperate and subarctic Northern Hemisphere breeding ranges. First summer birds usually remain in their wintering quarters, although a few return to breeding colonies some time after the arrival of the adults. In North America, the common tern breeds along the Atlantic coast from Labrador to North Carolina, and inland throughout much of Canada east of the Rocky Mountains. In the United States, some breeding populations can also be found in the states bordering the Great Lakes, and locally on the Gulf coast. There are small, only partially migratory, colonies in the Caribbean; these are in The Bahamas and Cuba, and off Venezuela in the Los Roques and Las Aves archipelagos.</p><p>New World birds winter along both coasts of Central and South America, to Argentina on the east coast and to Northern Chile on the west coast. Records from South America and the Azores show that some birds may cross the Atlantic in both directions on their migration.</p><p>The common tern breeds across most of Europe, with the highest numbers in the north and east of the continent. There are small populations on the north African coast, and in the Azores, Canary Islands and Madeira. Most winter off western or southern Africa, birds from the south and west of Europe tending to stay north of the equator and other European birds moving further south. The breeding range continues across the temperate and taiga zones of Asia, with scattered outposts on the Persian Gulf and the coast of Iran. Small populations breed on islands off Sri Lanka, and in the Ladakh region of the Tibetan plateau. Western Asian birds winter in the northern Indian Ocean, and <i>S.\u00a0h.\u00a0tibetana</i> appears to be common off East Africa during the northern hemisphere winter. Birds from further north and east in Asia, such as <i>S.\u00a0h.\u00a0longipennis</i>, move through Japan, Thailand and the western Pacific as far as southern Australia. There are small and erratic colonies in West Africa, in Nigeria and Guinea-Bissau, unusual in that they are within what is mainly a wintering area. Only a few common terns have been recorded in New Zealand, and this species' status in Polynesia is unclear. A bird ringed at the nest in Sweden was found dead on Stewart Island, New Zealand, five months later, having flown an estimated 25,000\u00a0km (15,000\u00a0mi).</p>\n\n<p>As long distance migrants, common terns sometimes occur well outside their normal range. Stray birds have been found inland in Africa (Zambia and Malawi), and on the Maldives and Comoros islands; the nominate subspecies has reached Australia, the Andes, and the interior of South America. Asian <i>S.\u00a0h.\u00a0longipennis</i> has recent records from western Europe.</p><p>The common tern breeds over a wider range of habitats than any of its relatives, nesting from the taiga of Asia to tropical shores, and at altitudes up to 2,000\u00a0m (6,600\u00a0ft) in Armenia, and 4,800\u00a0m (15,700\u00a0ft) in Asia. It avoids areas which are frequently exposed to excessive rain or wind, and also icy waters, so it does not breed as far north as the Arctic tern. The common tern breeds close to freshwater or the sea on almost any open flat habitat, including sand or shingle beaches, firm dune areas, salt marsh, or, most commonly, islands. Flat grassland or heath, or even large flat rocks may be suitable in an island environment. In mixed colonies, common terns will tolerate somewhat longer ground vegetation than Arctic terns, but avoid the even taller growth acceptable to roseate terns; the relevant factor here is the different leg lengths of the three species. Common terns adapt readily to artificial floating rafts, and may even nest on flat factory roofs. Unusual nest sites include hay bales, a stump 0.6\u00a0m (2\u00a0ft) above the water, and floating logs or vegetation. There is a record of a common tern taking over a spotted sandpiper nest and laying its eggs with those of the wader. Outside the breeding season, all that is needed in terms of habitat is access to fishing areas, and somewhere to land. In addition to natural beaches and rocks, boats, buoys and piers are often used both as perches and night-time roosts.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Behaviour\">Behaviour</span></h2>\n<h3><span id=\"Territory\">Territory</span></h3>\n\n\n<p>The common tern breeds in colonies which do not normally exceed 2,000 pairs, but may occasionally number more than 20,000 pairs. Colonies inland tend to be smaller than on the coast. Common terns often nest alongside other coastal species, such as Arctic, roseate and Sandwich terns, black-headed gulls, and black skimmers. Especially in the early part of the breeding season, for no known reason, most or all of the terns will fly in silence low and fast out to sea. This phenomenon is called a \"dread\".</p>\n\n<p>On their return to the breeding sites, the terns may loiter for a few days before settling into a territory, and the actual start of nesting may be linked to a high availability of fish. Terns defend only a small area, with distances between nests sometimes being as little as 50\u00a0cm (20\u00a0in), although 150\u2013350\u00a0cm (59\u2013138\u00a0in) is more typical. As with many birds, the same site is re-used year after year, with a record of one pair returning for 17 successive breeding seasons. Around 90% of experienced birds reuse their former territory, so young birds must nest on the periphery, find a bereaved mate, or move to another colony. A male selects a nesting territory a few days after his arrival in the spring, and is joined by his previous partner unless she is more than five days late, in which case the pair may separate.</p><p>The defence of the territory is mainly by the male, who repels intruders of either sex. He gives an alarm call, opens his wings, raises his tail and bows his head to show the black cap. If the intruder persists, the male stops calling and fights by bill grappling until the intruder submits by raising its head to expose the throat. Aerial trespassers are simply attacked, sometimes following a joint upward spiralling flight. Despite the aggression shown to adults, wandering chicks are usually tolerated, whereas in a gull colony they would be attacked and killed. The nest is defended until the chicks have fledged, and all the adults in the colony will collectively repel potential predators.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Breeding\">Breeding</span></h3>\n<p>Pairs are established or confirmed through aerial courtship displays in which a male and a female fly in wide circles up to 200\u00a0m (660\u00a0ft) or more, calling all the while, before the two birds descend together in zigzag glides. If the male is carrying a fish, he may attract the attention of other males too. On the ground, the male courts the female by circling her with his tail and neck raised, head pointing down, and wings partially open. If she responds, they may both adopt a posture with the head pointed skywards. The male may tease a female with the fish, not parting with his offering until she has displayed to him sufficiently. Once courtship is complete, the male makes a shallow depression in the sand, and the female scratches in the same place. Several trials may take place until the pair settle on a site for the actual nest. The eggs may be laid on bare sand, gravel or soil, but a lining of debris or vegetation is often added if available, or the nest may be rimmed with seaweed, stones or shells. The saucer-shaped scrape is typically 4\u00a0cm (1.6\u00a0in) deep and 10\u00a0cm (3.9\u00a0in) across, but may extend to as much as 24\u00a0cm (9.4\u00a0in) wide including the surrounding decorative material. Breeding success in areas prone to flooding has been enhanced by the provision of artificial mats made from eelgrass, which encourage the terns to nest in higher, less vulnerable areas, since many prefer the mats to bare sand. The common tern tends to use more nest material than roseate or Arctic terns, although roseate often nests in areas with more growing vegetation.</p>\n\n\n<p>Terns are expert at locating their nests in a large colony. Studies show that terns can find and excavate their eggs when they are buried, even if the nest material is removed and the sand smoothed over. They will find a nest placed 5\u00a0m (16\u00a0ft) from its original site, or even further if it is moved in several stages. Eggs are accepted if reshaped with plasticine or coloured yellow (but not red or blue). This ability to locate the eggs is an adaptation to life in an unstable, wind-blown and tidal environment.</p><p>The peak time for egg production is early May, with some birds, particularly first-time breeders, laying later in the month or in June. The clutch size is normally three eggs; larger clutches probably result from two females laying in the same nest. Egg size averages 41\u00a0mm \u00d7\u00a031\u00a0mm (1.6\u00a0in \u00d7\u00a01.2\u00a0in), although each successive egg in a clutch is slightly smaller than the first laid. The average egg weight is 20.2\u00a0g (0.71\u00a0oz), of which 5% is shell. The egg weight depends on how well-fed the female is, as well as on its position in the clutch. The eggs are cream, buff, or pale brown, marked with streaks, spots or blotches of black, brown or grey which help to camouflage them. Incubation is by both sexes, although more often by the female, and lasts 21\u201322\u00a0days, extending to 25\u00a0days if there are frequent disturbances at the colony which cause the adults to leave the eggs unattended; nocturnal predation may lead to incubation taking up to 34\u00a0days. On hot days the incubating parent may fly to water to wet its belly feathers before returning to the eggs, thus affording the eggs some cooling. Except when the colony suffers disaster, 90% of the eggs hatch. The precocial downy chick is yellowish with black or brown markings, and like the eggs, is similar to the equivalent stage of the Arctic tern. The chicks fledge in 22\u201328\u00a0days, usually 25\u201326. Fledged juveniles are fed at the nest for about five days, and then accompany the adults on fishing expeditions. The young birds may receive supplementary feeds from the parents until the end of the breeding season, and beyond. Common terns have been recorded feeding their offspring on migration and in the wintering grounds, at least until the adults move further south in about December.</p>\n\n<p>Like many terns, this species is very defensive of its nest and young, and will harass humans, dogs, muskrats and most diurnal birds, but unlike the more aggressive Arctic tern, it rarely hits the intruder, usually swerving off at the last moment. Adults can discriminate between individual humans, attacking familiar people more intensely than strangers. Nocturnal predators do not elicit similar attacks; colonies can be wiped out by rats, and adults desert the colony for up to eight hours when great horned owls are present.</p><p>Common terns usually breed once a year. Second clutches are possible if the first is lost. Rarely, a second clutch may be laid and incubated while some chicks from the first clutch are still being fed. The first breeding attempt is usually at four years of age, sometimes at three years. The average number of young per pair surviving to fledging can vary from zero in the event of the colony being flooded to over 2.5 in a good year. In North America, productivity was between 1.0 and 2.0 on islands, but less than 1.0 at coastal and inland sites. Birds become more successful at raising chicks with age. This continues throughout their breeding lives, but the biggest increase is in the first five years. The maximum documented lifespan in the wild is 23\u00a0years in North America and 33\u00a0years in Europe, but 12\u00a0years is a more typical lifespan.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Food_and_feeding\">Food and feeding</span></h3>\n\n<p>Like all <i>Sterna</i> terns, the common tern feeds by plunge-diving for fish, from a height of 1\u20136\u00a0m (3.3\u201319.7\u00a0ft), either in the sea or in freshwater lakes and large rivers. The bird may submerge for a second or so, but to no more than 50\u00a0cm (20\u00a0in) below the surface. When seeking fish, this tern flies head-down and with its bill held vertically. It may circle or hover before diving, and then plunges directly into the water, whereas the Arctic tern favours a \"stepped-hover\" technique, and the roseate tern dives at speed from a greater height, and submerges for longer. The common tern typically forages up to 5\u201310\u00a0km (3.1\u20136.2\u00a0mi) away from the breeding colony, sometimes as far as 15\u00a0km (9.3\u00a0mi). It will follow schools of fish, and its west African migration route is affected by the location of huge shoals of sardines off the coast of Ghana; it will also track groups of predatory fish or dolphins, waiting for their prey to be driven to the sea's surface. Terns often feed in flocks, especially if food is plentiful, and the fishing success rate in a flock is typically about one-third higher than for individuals.</p><p>Terns have red oil droplets in the cone cells of the retinas of their eyes. This improves contrast and sharpens distance vision, especially in hazy conditions. Birds that have to see through an air/water interface, such as terns and gulls, have more strongly coloured carotenoid pigments in the cone oil drops than other avian species. The improved eyesight helps terns to locate shoals of fish, although it is uncertain whether they are sighting the phytoplankton on which the fish feed, or observing other terns diving for food. Tern's eyes are not particularly ultraviolet sensitive, an adaptation more suited to terrestrial feeders like the gulls.</p>\n\n<p>The common tern preferentially hunts fish 5\u201315\u00a0cm (2.0\u20135.9\u00a0in) long. The species caught depend on what is available, but if there is a choice, terns feeding several chicks will take larger prey than those with smaller broods. The proportion of fish fed to chicks may be as high as 95% in some areas, but invertebrate prey may form a significant part of the diet elsewhere. This may include worms, leeches, molluscs such as small squid, and crustaceans (prawns, shrimp and mole crabs). In freshwater areas, large insects may be caught, such as beetles, cockchafers and moths. Adult insects may be caught in the air, and larvae picked from the ground or from the water surface. Prey is caught in the bill and either swallowed head-first, or carried back to the chicks. Occasionally, two or more small fish may be carried simultaneously. When adults take food back to the nest, they recognise their young by call, rather than visual identification.</p><p>The common tern may attempt to steal fish from Arctic terns, but might itself be harassed by kleptoparasitic skuas, laughing gulls, roseate terns, or by other common terns while bringing fish back to its nest. In one study, two males whose mates had died spent much time stealing food from neighbouring broods.</p><p>Terns normally drink in flight, usually taking seawater in preference to freshwater, if both are available. Chicks do not drink before fledging, reabsorbing water, and, like adults, excreting excess salt in a concentrated solution from a specialised nasal gland. Fish bones and the hard exoskeletons of crustaceans or insects are regurgitated as pellets. Adults fly off the nest to defecate, and even small chicks walk a short distance from the scrape to deposit their faeces. Adults attacking animals or humans will often defecate as they dive, often successfully fouling the intruder.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Predators_and_parasites\">Predators and parasites</span></h2>\n<p>Rats will take tern eggs, and may even store large numbers in caches, and the American mink is an important predator of hatched chicks, both in North America, and in Scotland where it has been introduced. The red fox can also be a local problem. Because common terns nest on islands, the most common predators are normally other birds rather than mammals. The ruddy turnstone will take eggs from unattended nests, and gulls may take chicks. Great horned owls and short-eared owls will kill both adults and chicks, and black-crowned night herons will also eat small chicks. Merlins and peregrine falcons may attack flying terns; as with other birds, it seems likely that one advantage of flocking behaviour is to confuse fast-flying predators.</p><p>The common tern hosts feather lice, which are quite different from those found in Arctic terns, despite the close relationship of the two birds. It may also be infected by parasitic worms, such as the widespread <i>Diphyllobothrium</i> species, the duck parasite <i>Ligula intestinalis</i>, and <i>Schistocephalus</i> species carried initially by fish. Tapeworms of the family Cyclophyllidea may also infect this species. The mite <i>Reighardia sternae</i> has been found in common terns from Italy, North America and China. A study of 75 breeding common terns found that none carried blood parasites. Colonies have been affected by avian cholera and ornithosis, and it is possible that the common tern may be threatened in the future by outbreaks of avian influenza to which it is susceptible. In 1961 the common tern was the first wild bird species identified as infected with avian influenza, the H5N3 variant being found in an outbreak of South African birds.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Status\">Status</span></h2>\n\n<p>The common tern is classed as least concern on the IUCN Red List. It has a large population of 1,600,000\u20134,600,000 mature individuals and a huge breeding range estimated at 29,200,000\u00a0km<sup>2</sup> (11,300,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi). Breeding numbers have been estimated at 250,000\u2013500,000 pairs, the majority breeding in Asia. Up to 140,000 pairs breed in Europe. Fewer than 80,000 pairs breed in North America, with most breeding on the northeast Atlantic coast and a declining population of less than 10,000 pairs breeding in the Great Lakes region.</p><p>In the nineteenth century, the use of tern feathers and wings in the millinery trade was the main cause of large reductions in common tern populations in both Europe and North America, especially on the Atlantic coasts and inland. Sometimes entire stuffed birds were used to make hats. Numbers largely recovered early in the twentieth century mainly due to legislation and the work of conservation organizations. Although some Eurasian populations are stable, numbers in North America have fallen by more than 70% in the last 40\u00a0years, and there is an overall negative trend in the global estimates for this species.</p><p>Threats come from habitat loss through building, pollution or vegetation growth, or disturbance of breeding birds by humans, vehicles, boats or dogs. Local natural flooding may lead to nest losses, and some colonies are vulnerable to predation by rats and large gulls. Gulls also compete with terns for nest sites. Some birds are hunted in the Caribbean for commercial sale as food. Breeding success may be enhanced by the use of floating nest rafts, man-made islands or other artificial nest sites, and by preventing human disturbance. Overgrown vegetation may be burned to clear the ground, and gulls can be killed or discouraged by deliberate disturbance. Contamination with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) resulted in enhanced levels of feminisation in male embryos, which seemed to disappear prior to fledging, with no effect on colony productivity, but dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE), which results from the breakdown of DDT, led to very low levels of successful breeding in some US locations.</p><p>The common tern is one of the species to which the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA) and the US-Canada Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918 apply. Parties to the AWEA agreement are required to engage in a wide range of conservation strategies described in a detailed action plan. The plan is intended to address key issues such as species and habitat conservation, management of human activities, research, education, and implementation. The North American legislation is similar, although there is a greater emphasis on protection.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"See_also\">See also</span></h2>\n<ul><li>Lake Bant tern colony</li></ul><h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n\n<h2><span id=\"Cited_texts\">Cited texts</span></h2>\n<ul><li><cite id=\"CITEREFBeamanMadge,_SteveBurn,_HilaryZetterstrom,_Dan1998\" class=\"citation book\">Beaman, Mark; Madge, Steve; Burn, Hilary; Zetterstrom, Dan (1998). <i>The Handbook of Bird Identification: For Europe and the Western Palearctic</i>.

It belongs to the genus <i>Columba</i> and, like all pigeons and doves, belongs to the family Columbidae. It is locally known in southeast England as the \"<b>culver</b>\"; This name has given rise to several areas known for keeping pigeons to be named after it, such as Culver Down.\n</p>\n\n\n<h2><span id=\"Taxonomy\">Taxonomy</span></h2>\n<p>The common wood pigeon was formally described by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his <i>Systema Naturae</i>. He placed it with all the other pigeons in the genus <i>Columba</i> and coined the binomial name <i>Columba palumbus</i>. The specific epithet <i>palumbus</i> is from the Latin <i>palumbes</i> for a wood-pigeon.</p><p>Five subspecies are recognised, one of which is now extinct:</p>\n<ul><li><i>C. p. palumbus</i> Linnaeus, 1758 \u2013 Europe to west Siberia and Iraq; northwest Africa</li>\n<li>\u2020 <i>C. p. maderensis</i> Tschusi, 1904 \u2013 Madeira (extinct)</li>\n<li><i>C. p. azorica</i> Hartert, 1905 \u2013 east and central Azores</li>\n<li><i>C. p. iranica</i> (Zarudny, 1910) \u2013 southwest and north Iran to southwest Turkmenistan</li>\n<li><i>C. p. casiotis</i> (Bonaparte, 1854) \u2013 southeast Iran to Kazakhstan to west China, northwest India and Nepal</li></ul><h2><span id=\"Description\">Description</span></h2>\n\n<p>The three Western European <i>Columba</i> pigeons, common wood pigeon, stock dove, and rock pigeon, though superficially alike, have very distinctive characteristics; the common wood pigeon may be identified at once by its larger size at 38\u201344.5\u00a0cm (15.0\u201317.5\u00a0in) and weight 300\u2013615\u00a0g (10.6\u201321.7\u00a0oz), and the white on its neck and wing. It is otherwise a basically grey bird, with a pinkish breast. The wingspan can range from 68 to 80\u00a0cm (27 to 31\u00a0in) and the wing chord measures 24 to 25.4\u00a0cm (9.4 to 10.0\u00a0in). The tail measures 13.8 to 15\u00a0cm (5.4 to 5.9\u00a0in), the bill is 1.9 to 2.2\u00a0cm (0.75 to 0.87\u00a0in) and the tarsus is 2.5 to 2.8\u00a0cm (0.98 to 1.10\u00a0in). Adult birds bear a series of green and white patches on their necks, and a pink patch on their chest.\n</p><p>Juvenile birds do not have the white patches on either side of the neck. When they are about six months old (about three months out of the nest) they gain small white patches on both sides of the neck, which gradually enlarge until they are fully formed when the bird is about 6\u20138 months old (approx. ages only). Juvenile birds also have a greyer beak and an overall lighter grey appearance than adult birds.\nThe call is a characteristic cooing, <i>coo-COO-coo-coo-coo</i>.\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Distribution_and_habitat\">Distribution and habitat</span></h2>\n<p>In the colder northern and eastern parts of Europe and western Asia the common wood pigeon is a migrant, but in southern and western Europe it is a well distributed and often abundant resident. In Great Britain wood pigeons are commonly seen in parks and gardens and are seen with increasing numbers in towns and cities.\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Behaviour\">Behaviour</span></h2>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Its flight is quick, performed by regular beats, with an occasional sharp flick of the wings, characteristic of pigeons in general. It takes off with a loud clattering. It perches well, and in its nuptial display walks along a horizontal branch with swelled neck, lowered wings, and fanned tail. During the display flight the bird climbs, the wings are smartly cracked like a whiplash, and the bird glides down on stiff wings. The common wood pigeon is gregarious, often forming very large flocks outside the breeding season. Like many species of pigeon, wood pigeons take advantage of trees and buildings to gain a vantage point over the surrounding area, and their distinctive call means that they are usually heard before they are seen.\n</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Breeding\">Breeding</span></h3>\n<p> It breeds in trees in woods, parks and gardens, laying two white eggs in a simple stick nest which hatch after 17 to 19 days. Wood pigeons seem to have a preference for trees near roadways and rivers. Males exhibit aggressive behaviour towards each other during the breeding season by jumping and flapping wings at each other. Their plumage becomes much darker, especially the head, during hot summer periods. Breeding can happen year round if there is food abundant however breeding season most commonly occurs in autumn usually in the months of August and September. \n</p><p>The nests are vulnerable to attack, particularly by crows, because they live in the countryside, the more so early in the year when the leaf cover is not fully formed. The young usually fly at 33 to 34 days; however, if the nest is disturbed, some young may be able to survive having left the nest as early as 20 days from hatching.\n</p><p>In a study carried out using ring-recovery data, the survival rate for juveniles in their first year was 52\u00a0per cent, and the adult annual survival rate was 61\u00a0per cent. For birds that survive the first year the typical lifespan is thus only three years, but the maximum recorded age is 17 years and 8 months for a bird ringed and recovered on the Orkney Islands.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Diet\">Diet</span></h3>\n<p>Most of its diet is vegetable, round and fleshy leaves from Caryophyllaceae, Asteraceae, and cruciferous vegetables taken from open fields or gardens and lawns; young shoots and seedlings are favoured, and it will take grain, pine nuts, and certain fruits and berries. In the autumn they also eat figs and acorns, and in winter buds of trees and bushes. They will also eat larvae, ants, and small worms. They need open water to drink and bathe in. This species can be an agricultural pest, and it is often shot, being a legal quarry species in most European countries. It is wary in rural areas, but often quite tame where it is not persecuted. Young common wood pigeons swiftly become fat, as a result of the crop milk they are fed by their parents. This is an extremely rich fluid that is produced in the adult birds' crops during the breeding season.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Predators\">Predators</span></h2>\n<p>Predators include:\n</p>\n<ul><li>Eurasian sparrowhawk</li>\n<li>Northern goshawk</li>\n<li>Domestic cat</li>\n<li>Poachers</li>\n<li>Crows</li></ul><h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n\n<h2><span id=\"Sources\">Sources</span></h2>\n\n<h2><span id=\"External_links\">External links</span></h2>\n<ul><li>Xeno-canto: audio recordings of the common wood pigeon</li>\n<li>Woodpigeon videos, photos &amp; sounds on the Internet Bird Collection</li>\n<li>Ageing and sexing of the common wood pigeon by Javier Blasco-Zumeta &amp; Gerd-Michael Heinze</li>\n<li>Feathers of Common Wood Pigeon (<i>Columba palumbus</i>) by Hans Schick</li></ul>"

It is now usually considered a member of the family Vangidae. It is small and ashy brown with a dark cheek patch and a broad white brow. It is found across Asia mainly in thin forest and scrub habitats where they hunt insects, often joining other insectivorous birds. The form found in Sri Lanka which was treated as a subspecies is now usually considered a separate species, the Sri Lanka woodshrike.\n</p>\n\n\n<h2><span id=\"Description\">Description</span></h2>\n<p>The common woodshrike is dully ashy brown and like other woodshrikes has a large head with a strong hooked beak. They have a broad creamy brow above a dark cheek patch and white outer tail feathers contrasting with their dark tail. Young birds have streaks and spot on the crown and white spots on the mantle. The underside is also streaked and the breast is heavily marked in young birds. The Sri Lankan species is similar darker on the underside, with the dark cheek bordered below by a buffy sub-moustachial stripe and a white rump.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Taxonomy\">Taxonomy</span></h2>\n<p>The genus name <i>Tephrodornis</i> is derived from the Greek root <i>tephra</i> (\u03c4\u03ad\u03c6\u03c1\u03b1) which refers to ash, the colour and <i>ornis</i> for bird. The species was described by J.F. Gmelin on the basis of a specimen that came from the Coromandel region, presumably Pondicherry on the basis of which he gave the species name. Claud Ticehurst however restricted the type locality of the nominate subspecies to Madras. He placed it along with the flycatchers in the genus <i>Muscicapa</i>. In the past the species included <i>Tephrodornis affinis</i> as a subspecies but that is now considered a full species restricted within Sri Lanka. The Sri Lankan species has distinct plumage as well as calls. Several subspecies have been named for the populations within the wide range of this species. The northwestern dry region form is paler and given the name of <i>pallidus</i> while the nominate population which has dark central tail feathers is found in peninsular India. The populations in Southeast Asia are placed in <i>orientis</i>.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Behaviour_and_ecology\">Behaviour and ecology</span></h2>\n\n<p>Usually found in pairs, they have a loud whistling song made of several notes. The usual call is a plaintive <i>weet-weet</i> followed by a series of quick <i>whi-whi-whi-whee?</i>. They have a loud song consisting of several rapid whistling notes. They feed on mainly on insects and sometimes berries by gleaning mostly along branches and leaves within trees but sometimes also make aerial sallies or descend to the ground. They have a habit of adjusting their wings, raising them over the tail shortly after alighting on a perch. They nest in summer before the rainy season, building a cup nest on a bare fork. The nest is made of fibres and bark held by cobwebs and covered with bits of bark and lichen. It is lined with silky plant fibres. Three eggs are the usual clutch. Both parents incubate but it is thought that only the female feeds the young. Young birds are fed on insects and berries. Two broods may be raised in some years.</p><p>A species of <i>Haemoproteus</i> was described from a Goan specimen of this species as <i>Haemoproteus tephrodornis</i> by Froilano de Mello in 1935. A spirurid nematode <i>Oxyspirura alii</i> was described and named after S. Mehdi Ali and obtained from within the eye cavity of a common woodshrike specimen from Hyderabad. Ticks of the species <i>Haemaphysalis bispinosa</i> and <i>H. intermedia</i> have been recorded on the species.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n\n<h2><span id=\"External_links\">External links</span></h2>\n<ul><li>Calls on Xeno-Canto</li></ul>"

Rand in 1948 was a coppersmith barbet from Mount Apo in Mindanao.<i>Megalaema haemacephala celestinoi</i> proposed by Ernest Thomas Gilliard in 1949 was a coppersmith barbet from Samar island of the Philippines.<i>Megalaema haemacephala cebuensis</i> and <i>Megalaema haemacephala homochroa</i> proposed by Victoria Dziadosz and Kenneth Parkes in 1984 were coppersmith barbets from Toledo, Cebu and Tablas Island, respectively.</p><p>Molecular phylogenetic research of barbets revealed that <i>Megalaima</i> species form a clade, which also includes the fire-tufted barbet, the only species placed in the genus <i>Psilopogon</i> at the time. Asian barbets were therefore reclassified under <i>Psilopogon</i>, which is the older scientific name. The coppersmith barbet is one of the oldest Asian barbets in terms of genetic divergence and speciation.\nNine coppersmith barbet subspecies are recognized as of 2014:</p>\n<ul><li>the nominate subspecies <i>P. h. haemacephalus</i> occurs in Luzon and Mindoro</li>\n<li><i>P. h. indicus</i> ranges from northeastern Pakistan to Sri Lanka, China, Vietnam and Singapore</li>\n<li><i>P. h. roseus</i> occurs in Java and Bali</li>\n<li><i>P. h. intermedia</i> occurs in Panay, Guimaras and Negros</li>\n<li><i>P. h. delicus</i> occurs in Sumatra</li>\n<li><i>P. h. mindanensis</i> occurs in Mindanao</li>\n<li><i>P. h. celestinoi</i> occurs in Samar, Catanduanes, Biliran, and Leyte</li>\n<li><i>P. h. cebuensis</i> occurs in Cebu</li>\n<li><i>P. h. homochroa</i> occurs in Tablas Island</li></ul><h2><span id=\"Distribution_and_habitat\">Distribution and habitat</span></h2>\n\n<p>Throughout its range, it inhabits gardens, groves and sparse woodland. Habitats with dead wood suitable for excavation of nests are important.</p><p>In the Palni Hills it occurs below 1,200\u00a0m (4,000\u00a0ft). In northern India, it occurs in the valleys of the outer Himalayas up to 910\u00a0m (3,000\u00a0ft). It is rare in northwestern Indian states and  in wet forests in Assam.</p><p>The coppersmith barbet's range overlaps with several larger barbets in most of South Asia. In the Western Ghats, its range partly overlaps with the Malabar barbet.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Behaviour_and_ecology\">Behaviour and ecology</span></h2>\n<p>The coppersmith barbet lives solitary or in small groups; larger parties have occasionally been sighted in abundantly fruiting Ficus trees. It appears to be fond of sunning in the morning on bare top branches of tall trees, often flitting about to sit next to each other. Its flight is straight, with rapid flaps.</p><p>It competes with other cavity nesting birds and frugivores. Blue-throated barbets have been seen evicting coppersmith barbets from their nest holes, while red-vented bulbuls have been seen to indulge in kleptoparasitism, robbing the male of berries brought to the female at the nest.</p><p>The nest holes are also used for roosting and some birds roost alone in cavities and these often roost during part of the day. Immatures will roost with the parents but often return to roost early so as not to be prevented by the parents from entering the roost cavity.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Vocalization\">Vocalization</span></h3>\n<p>The call is a loud rather metallic <i>tuk\u2026tuk\u2026tuk</i> (or <i>tunk</i>), reminiscent of a copper sheet being beaten, giving the bird its name.  Repeated monotonously for long periods, starting with a subdued <i>tuk</i> and building up to an even volume and tempo, the latter varying from 108 to 121 per minute and can continue with as many as 204 notes. They are silent and do not call in winter.</p><p>The beak remains shut during each call - a patch of bare skin on both sides of the throat inflates and collapses with each <i>tuk</i> like a rubber bulb and the head is bobbed.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Diet\">Diet</span></h3>\n<p>The coppersmith barbet prefers banyan, peepul, and other wild figs, various drupes and berries, and the occasional insect, caught in aerial sallies. It also feeds on flower petals. It eats nearly 1.5 to nearly 3 times its own body weight in berries each day.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Breeding\">Breeding</span></h3>\n<p>Courtship involves singing, puffing of the throat, bobbing of the head, flicking of the tail, ritual feeding and allopreening. Birds nest and roost in cavities.</p><p>It breeds through much of the year with local variation. The breeding season is mainly February to April in India and December to September in Sri Lanka. Both sexes excavate the nest on the underside of a narrow horizontal branch. They also roost inside the nest holes. The female lays three or four eggs. Both sexes incubate. The Incubation period is not well known, but has been estimated to be about two weeks. Often two broods are raised in quick succession.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Mortality_factors\">Mortality factors</span></h3>\n<p>Adult birds are sometimes taken by predatory species.

They are among the smallest waterfowl in the world and are found in small to large waterbodies with good aquatic vegetation. They are usually seen in pairs or larger groups of pairs, roosting and nesting on trees near water. They are strong fliers and are known to disperse widely, especially in winter. Their breeding season coincides with the rains.\n</p>\n\n\n<h2><span id=\"Description\">Description</span></h2>\n\n<p>Small individuals of this species are the smallest waterfowl on earth, at as little as 160\u00a0g (5.6\u00a0oz) and 26\u00a0cm (10\u00a0in). The goose-like bill is short and deep at the base. Males have a dark brown forehead and crown and a blackish green broad collar at the base of the neck. The sides of the head and neck are whitish. The back, wing coverts and scapulars are dark brown with green and purple gloss. The female has a duller cap and a brown line through the eye. The collar is replaced by spots and the face is flecked and neck finely vermiculated unlike the male. The non-breeding or eclipse male resembles the female except that it has the broader white wing band. In flight the male has dark wings with white flight feathers tipped in black. The female has dark wings and a white trailing edge to the secondaries and a few inner primaries. They have a red iris and black legs (greenish in breeding males) and bill.</p><p>Downy chicks have white superciliary stripes that meet at the back of the head which is black. A short dark eye stripe is present on the whitish face. The upperside of the neck is grey. The mantle is grey brown and two white patches are present on the scapulars. The tail is dark grey to black. The underside is buff.</p>\n\n<p>The hind toe is narrowly lobed. The nostril is small and oval and opens close to the base of the commissure of the bill.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Taxonomy_and_systematics\">Taxonomy and systematics</span></h2>\n<p>The cotton pygmy goose was first described and given a binomial name by Gmelin in 1789 who called it <i>Anas coromandeliana</i>. The French naturalist Buffon had called it Sarcelle de Coromandel. It was then placed under <i>Cheniscus</i> before being relatively stably placed in the genus <i>Nettapus</i> within the tribe Cairinini that includes other perching ducks. It is one of three species in the genus, noted for sexual dimorphism, and is the only species in which there is a marked difference in the non-breeding plumage of the males. Two subspecies are recognized. The nominate form is found in India, Asia extending east to New Guinea. The population in eastern Australia is placed in the subspecies <i>albipennis</i> (first described by Gould in 1842). It is marginally larger in dimensions.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Distribution_and_habitat\">Distribution and habitat</span></h2>\n\n<p>This species is widely distributed across Asia, its distribution extending to Australia. Population move in response to rain and water availability. Some populations disperse further in summer (and are found only seasonally, for instance in Afghanistan). Winter dispersal is also wide and individuals have been seen as far west as Arabia, and Jordan and they are regularly found on islands in the region such as the Maldives and the Andamans. They are found especially in lakes and ponds with emergent vegetation amid which they forage. They can be found even in small village ponds in South Asia. In Australia they are found mainly in lagoons. They are said to roost on trees.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Behaviour_and_ecology\">Behaviour and ecology</span></h2>\n<p>Several pairs of the bird may forage in close proximity on a single waterbody. Large flocks form in winter and a flock of nearly 6000 was recorded at Chilka lake. This species feeds mainly at the surface of the water. Stomach analysis showed that they fed on small fishes <i>Puntius</i>, <i>Mystus</i>, <i>Oryzias</i>, molluscs, crustaceans, insect larvae as well as plant matter from species such as <i>Ipomoea</i>, <i>Hydrilla</i> and <i>Ruppia</i>. They do not dive or up-end and take to flight from the water surface without having to run or patter on the surface. They fly swiftly, often low over water, and are agile enough to escape falcons. Courtship displays are largely undocumented but a post-copulatory display involves the male arching neck, displaying the white neck feathers and the white wing patches. They pair up during the breeding season which is mainly during the rains (monsoons in June\u2013August India and January to March in Australia) and build their nests mainly in natural tree hollows, such as tree trunks. The males assist in locating nests but incubation is thought to be by the female alone which lays 6 to 12 ivory-colored eggs per clutch. The nest may as high as five metres from the ground and chicks leap off to follow their parents into water. Larger clutches have been recorded and are thought to be due to intraspecific brood-parasitism.</p><p>Rock pythons have been recorded preying on cotton teal<i>.</i> <i>Plasmodium circumflexum</i> was found in their blood of a specimen examined in Bangladesh. Three species of parasitic cestode <i>Hymenolepis smythi</i>, <i>H. fista</i> and <i>Retinometra fista</i> are known from hosts of the species. The trematode <i>Cyclocoelum</i> sp. was recorded as a parasite in Queensland. <i>Paramonostomum thapari</i> was described from a cotton teal.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"In_culture\">In culture</span></h2>\n<p>They were hunted with shotguns especially in British India, although they were not considered particularly good eating. Eggs were collected for food and the birds were sold in large numbers in the birds markets of Calcutta in the 19th century. Fishermen in the Sunderbans set up twenty-foot high nets and drove birds on the water toward the nets before alarming them and getting them to fly into the nets. Injured birds were noted to submerge and hide themselves with only the head or bill out of water. In Burma, birds have been recorded nesting within buildings. Sir Harcourt Butler noted a nest at a height of 68\u00a0ft (21\u00a0m) under the eaves of the roof of the residence of the governor in Rangoon. Hume noted that the numbers of migratory ducks sold in the Calcutta markets declined over ten years but not those of the cotton teal. He also noted their tameness, dabbling about within ten yards of a village washerman noisily thrashing clothes.</p><p>The Sinhala name of <i lang=\"si-Latn\" title=\"Sinhala-language romanization\">mal saar</i> or flower teal is based on the colours and possibly the habitat of lily-covered ponds. Many native names (such as <i>lerreget-perreget</i>) are onomatopoeic. The name \"cotton teal\" was used by Europeans near Bombay who noted that the bird had a lot of white feathers. They produce a low quacky call which has been likened to <i>quacky duck, quacky duck</i> or <i>fixed bayonets</i> (in British India). Samuel Tickell recorded a Kol name from Singhbum of <i>Merom-derebet</i>, merom being a goat and the call likened to a bleat.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n\n<h2><span id=\"External_links\">External links</span></h2>\n<ul><li>Call recordings on Xeno-Canto</li>\n<li>BirdLife Species Factsheet</li></ul> "

        "details": "<p class=\"mw-empty-elt\">\n</p>\n<p>The <b>crested serpent eagle</b> (<i>Spilornis cheela</i>) is a medium-sized bird of prey that is found in forested habitats across tropical Asia. Within its widespread range across the Indian Subcontinent, Southeast Asia and East Asia, there are considerable variations and some authorities prefer to treat several of its subspecies as completely separate species. In the past, several species including the Philippine serpent eagle (<i>S. holospila</i>), Andaman serpent eagle (<i>S. elgini</i>) and South Nicobar serpent eagle (<i>S. klossi</i>) were treated as subspecies of the Crested serpent eagle. All members within the species complex have a large looking head with long feathers on the back of the head giving them a maned and crested appearance. The face is bare and yellow joining up with the ceres while the powerful feet are unfeathered and heavily scaled. They fly over the forest canopy on broad wings and tail have wide white and black bars. They call often with a loud, piercing and familiar three or two-note call. They often feed on snakes, giving them their name and are placed along with the <i>Circaetus</i> snake-eagles in the subfamily Circaetinae.\n</p>\n\n\n<h2><span id=\"Description\">Description</span></h2>\n\n<p>This medium-large, dark brown eagle is stocky, with rounded wings and a short tail. Its short black and white fan-shaped nuchal crest gives it a thick-necked appearance. The bare facial skin and feet are yellow. The underside is spotted with white and yellowish-brown. When perched the wing tips do not reach until the tail tip. In soaring flight, the broad and paddle-shaped wings are held in a shallow V. The tail and underside of the flight feathers are black with broad white bars. Young birds show a lot of white on the head. The tarsus is unfeathered and covered by hexagonal scales. The upper mandible does not have an overhanging festoon to the tip.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Distribution.2C_taxonomy_and_status\"></span><span id=\"Distribution,_taxonomy_and_status\">Distribution, taxonomy and status</span></h2>\n\n<p>Within its widespread range across tropical Asia, 21 populations have been named as subspecies.

Although the crested serpent eagle remains widespread and fairly common overall, some of the taxa that are restricted to small islands are believed to have relatively small populations that likely are in the hundreds. The rarest is probably the Bawean serpent eagle with a declining population of about 26\u201337 pairs, which makes it critically endangered.</p><p>The nominate subspecies has a black throat while the peninsular Indian form has a brownish throat. There are clinal latitudinal variations, with size decreasing southward. The small islands taxa are generally smaller in size than the taxa from the Asian mainland/larger islands in a phenomenon termed as insular dwarfism.</p><p>The specific name <i>cheela</i> is derived from the Hindi name for kites.\n</p><p>One syntype specimen of <i>Spilornis rutherfordi</i> Swinhoe (Ibis, 1870, p.85.), the Hainan subspecies, is held in the collections of National Museums Liverpool at World Museum, with accession number T2819 (male adult). The specimen was collected in Hainan, China in February 1868 by Robert Swinhoe and came to the Liverpool national collection via Canon Henry Baker Tristram\u2019s collection which was purchased in 1896.\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Behaviour_and_ecology\">Behaviour and ecology</span></h2>\n\n<p>The crested serpent eagle, as its English name suggests, is a reptile eater which hunts over forests, often close to wet grassland, for snakes and lizards. It has also been observed to prey on birds, amphibians, mammals and fishes. It is placed along with the snake eagles of the genus <i>Circaetus</i> in the subfamily Circaetinae. It is found mainly over areas with thick vegetation both on the low hills and the plains. This species is a resident species, but in some parts of their range they are found only in summer.</p><p>The call is a distinctive <i>Kluee-wip-wip</i> with the first note being high and rising. They call a lot in the late mornings from their perches where they spend a lot of time and they rise on thermals in the mornings. In southern Taiwan, males have a larger home range than females. Males on average had a home range of 16.7\u00a0km<sup>2</sup> while females used about 7\u00a0km<sup>2</sup>. When alarmed, they erect the crest and the head appears large and framed by the ruff. They will sometimes follow snakes on the ground. They roost in the interiors of trees with dense foliage. A radio-telemetric study of the species in Taiwan found that the birds spend 98% of the day perched and usually finding food in the morning hours. They appear to use a sit and wait foraging strategy.</p>\n\n<p>The breeding season begins in late winter when they start courting and establishing territories. The eggs are laid in early summer. Old nests are often refurbished and reused in India but a study in Penang found them to build fresh nests each year. A study in India found that most nests were built along riverine trees. The nest is a large platform built high on a tree. Both birds in a pair build the nest but the female alone incubates. The male guards when the female forages. In central India, the <i>Terminalia tomentosa</i> is often used while <i>Terminalia bellirica</i> and <i>Dalbergia latifolia</i> was often used in southern India. In Penang, the nest trees were typically large and isolated from other trees with lot of room for the birds to fly in and out. The nests are lined with green leaves collected from nearby and are placed facing down on the nest floor. The usual clutch is one egg but two are sometimes laid and only a single chick is successfully raised in a season. When eggs are lost, a replacement is laid two to seven weeks later. The eggs hatch after about 41 days and the young fledge after about two months. Nests are defended by the parents.</p><p>Several species of endoparasitic nematodes have been recovered from the intestines of crested serpent eagles, including <i>Madelinema angelae</i>. Avian pox virus infections which cause warts on the face have been observed in a wild bird living in Taiwan. A number of ectoparasitic bird lice have been described from the species including <i>Kurodaia cheelae</i>. In Penang, it was found that cinereous tits (<i>Parus cinereus ambiguus</i>) tended to nest close to nesting crested serpent eagles, presumably due to safety from predators like crows that may be driven off by the eagles. They have also been found to visit the nests of the eagles to collect fur from the remains of dead mammal prey.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n\n<h2><span id=\"External_links\">External links</span></h2>\n<ul><li> Media related to <span>Spilornis cheela</span> at Wikimedia Commons</li>\n<li> Data related to Spilornis cheela at Wikispecies</li>\n<li>Photographs and videos</li>\n<li>Call recordings</li></ul> "
